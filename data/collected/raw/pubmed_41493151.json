  "title": "Environmental determinants of therapeutic drug failure: a systematic review of heavy metal-induced inefficacy.",
  "abstract": "Therapeutic drug failure poses a significant global health burden, particularly in developing regions with high environmental toxicant exposure. While traditionally attributed to factors such as substandard drugs, genetic polymorphisms, and non-compliance, emerging evidence implicates heavy metals as under-recognized modulators of drug efficacy. This systematic review assessed how heavy metals potentially interfere with the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs. Following PRISMA guidelines, peer-reviewed articles published between 1999 and 2024 were retrieved from PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar. Studies investigating ",
