  "title": "Adherence to Inhaled Medication Guidelines in Patients with COPD: Evaluating the GOLD 2023 Strategy in a Real-World Secondary Care Setting.",
  "abstract": "The 2023 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) strategy introduced updates to the prescription of inhaled medication, including withdrawing recommendation of long-acting beta-agonist/inhaled corticosteroids (LABA/ICS) as double therapy, restricting ICS use to patients with exacerbations, and recommending earlier escalation to triple therapy. These changes are expected to have a substantial impact on clinical practice. This study aims to describe how well clinicians adhere to the GOLD strategy in daily practice, and to explore the extent to which the 2023 update has changed prescribing patterns.",
