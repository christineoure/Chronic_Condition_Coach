  "title": "Effectiveness of GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors in preventing T2DM in high-risk patients: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "There are conflicting results and limited data regarding the individual effectiveness of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and their combined action in preventing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in high-risk adults. An updated investigation is warranted. We aimed to explore their effectiveness in preventing T2DM in high-risk patients and assess changes in body weight/body mass index (BMI), glycemic parameters, and safety.",
