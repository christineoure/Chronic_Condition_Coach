  "summary": "Evidence suggests that prebiotic fibre can correct dysbiosis, reduce intestinal permeability and improve glycemic control. The investigators hypothesize that microbial changes induced by prebiotics contribute to gut and endocrine adaptations that reduce glucose fluctuations, including less hyper- and hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes (T1D). The primary objective is to compare the change in frequency of hypoglycemia from baseline to 6 months in n=144 individuals with T1D treated with a 6-month course of prebiotic or placebo as an adjunct to insulin. Secondary objectives will be aimed at understanding the mechanisms by which the prebiotics could affect glycemic control.",
