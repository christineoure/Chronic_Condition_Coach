  "title": "Unequal Access, Unequal Outcomes: Analyzing Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Hospital Admissions Across Clinical Commissioning Groups.",
  "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains a major cause of hospitalisation and mortality in England, with outcomes differing widely across Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs). This short communication highlights regional variation in COPD emergency admissions and 30 day readmission patterns using figures from the 2nd Atlas of Variation in Risk Factors and Healthcare for Respiratory Disease by Public Health England. Northern regions show higher rates than southern regions, reflecting variation in access to primary care, respiratory specialists, and pulmonary rehabilitation. These patterns indicate that supply sensitive factors contribute significantly to unequal outcomes. Reducing avoidable hospitalisations will require fairer resource allocation, earlier community based management, and stronger coordination between hospital and primary care services.",
