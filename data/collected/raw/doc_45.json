  "title": "Respiratory Muscle Strength and Mortality in Patients with COPD: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
  "abstract": "Respiratory muscle weakness is common in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), potentially carrying prognostic information beyond airflow limitation; however, clinical testing remains variably standardized, and its independent association with survival is uncertain. We evaluated whether respiratory muscle strength is associated with survival in patients with COPD, and summarized implementation-relevant evidence for other indices.",
