  "abstract": "Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) has emerged as a useful tool for monitoring airway inflammation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. We designed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) on FeNO levels compared to healthy controls and stable patients.",
