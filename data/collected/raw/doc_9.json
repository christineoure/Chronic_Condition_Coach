  "abstract": "Through the use of teleassistance, nurses play a fundamental role in the management of chronic cardiovascular diseases, contributing to improving patients' perceived quality of life and promoting self-care practices. This model of care actively supports the development of mindful and proactive behaviors by patients in managing their own lifestyle habits. Furthermore, teleassistance is an effective tool in promoting therapeutic adherence, particularly in the post-hospital discharge phase. The literature review carried out in this study confirms these benefits. However, there is a need to explore the effectiveness of nursing teleassistance in relation to other relevant clinical outcomes, such as the reduction of new hospitalizations, post-discharge complications, mortality and healthcare-related costs.",
