  "summary": "Medial compartment osteoarthritis of the knee is commonly treated by a surgical intervention called 'high tibial osteotomy' (VTO). Although it has repeatedly been shown that pain improves following this procedure, it is unknown how cartilage quality is affected by the procedure. In this study, a recently developed MRI technique is used to evaluate changes in cartilage quality before and after the surgery. Changes in MRI signals are correlated to subjective improvements (score lists). 10 patients participate in this study. Approval has been granted by the Medical Ethical Committee of the University Medical Center Utrecht. All participants are required to give informed consent before participation.",
