  "abstract": "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. For patients with a high disease burden, triple therapy with fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium bromide/vilanterol trifenatate (FF/UMEC/VI) has demonstrated significant benefits in health-related quality of life (HRQoL), exacerbation reduction, and lung function improvement. Efforts have been made to define clinical stability (CS), yet real-world data on CS during FF/UMEC/VI therapy remain limited. This retrospective study aimed to assess the prevalence of CS after 12 months (T12) of FF/UMEC/VI treatment in COPD patients. CS was defined as the concurrent presence at T12 of: no acute exacerbations in the prior 12 months, a \u2265 2-point improvement in COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score from baseline, and a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV",
