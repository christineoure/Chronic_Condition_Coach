  "title": "Self-efficacy in exercise behaviour in persons with a diagnosed condition: a systematic evidence map.",
  "abstract": "Self-efficacy is a major factor in enabling individuals to follow behavioural goals. This applies to health behaviours including physical activity and exercise behaviour, a health topic especially important for persons suffering from health conditions. In subjects with already existing conditions, self-efficacy in exercise behaviour is a research field with a high volume of published articles, yet it has never been charted in its entirety. This systematic evidence map (SEM) provides a comprehensive overview of the current state in published empirical research.",
