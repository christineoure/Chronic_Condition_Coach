  "title": "Pre-meal Consumption of Whey in Gestational Diabetes Mellitus From Diagnosis to Delivery",
  "conditions": [
    "Gestational Diabetes"
  ],
  "interventions": [
    "Whey",
    "Placebo"
  ],
  "phase": "NA",
  "summary": "The main objective of the study is to investigate the metabolic effects of whey protein (whey protein isolate, WPI, (Lacprodan\u00ae ISO.Water. from Arla Foods Ingredients) compared with placebo when consumed by women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) from diagnosis (around gestational week 28) to delivery. Any changes in substrate metabolism and energy expenditure using indirect calorimetry will also be investigated. Differences in hunger and satiety parameters as well as blood pressure and gestational weight gain will also be assessed. Furthermore, analysis on the glucose response when the women consume the intervention (whey or placebo) at home in their own environment 30 minutes before breakfast at time of diagnosis (earliest week 28) and week 36 (four days following each time point) will be made. The women will be monitored with continuous glucose monitors, activity monitors and all meals will be provided for two days following the study days in the laboratory. At delivery cord blood will be sampled for analysis on metabolic parameters and investigations on epigenetics/DNA methylations. Complications to the delivery, neonatal outcomes, anthropometrics of the child will also be assessed. Breast milk composition will also be analyzed.",
