  "title": "Natural transitions of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in children 9-11 years of age.",
  "abstract": "Unites States guidelines recommend universal lipid screening in children between ages 9-11 years, with follow-up screening at ages 17-21 years. Non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C) is the preferred marker. However, the stability of non-HDL-C within the screening window remains unclear. This study aimed to estimate the probabilities of non-HDL-C transitioning between its classifications (acceptable, borderline-high, and high) during the 9-11-year age period and the average duration it remains stable within each classification.",
