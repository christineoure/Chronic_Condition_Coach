  "summary": "This research study is an innovative school-based program for urban children with moderate to severe persistent or difficult-to-control asthma. The Telemedicine Enhanced Asthma Management-Uniting Providers (TEAM-UP) program enhances a school-based, primary care directed asthma program with specialist-supported care to ensure optimal guideline based treatment. This study is a full-scale randomized trial of TEAM-UP versus an enhanced care comparison group. Primary care physicians (PCP) of all enrolled children (n=360, 4-12 yrs.) will be prompted to initiate directly observed therapy (DOT) of preventive asthma medication through school and to make a specialist referral. For children in the TEAM-UP group, the specialist visits will be facilitated via telemedicine at school. The telemedicine specialist visit will be scheduled after approximately 4 weeks of initiating DOT, in order to allow for accurate guideline-based assessments of medication and care needs once adherence with a daily controller medication is established. There will also be up to 2 telemedicine follow-up specialist visits to assess the child's response to treatment and make needed adjustments. The study will use the existing community infrastructure by implementing both telemedicine and DOT in school, and maintaining collaboration with PCPs. Blinded follow-ups will occur at 3-, 5-, 7- and 12-months after baseline, and the primary outcome is the comparison of symptom-free days (SFD) at each follow-up time point.",
