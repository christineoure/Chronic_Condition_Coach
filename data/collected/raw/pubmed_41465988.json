  "title": "Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis with colonic perforation: A case report and literature review.",
  "abstract": "Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis (PCI) is an uncommon complaint that can produce free gas below the diaphragm, mimicking gastrointestinal perforation, which can easily lead to misdiagnosis. Although prognosis is generally good in most cases, complications can pose a threat to life and may require surgical intervention. Currently, clear surgical guidelines for PCI complicated by colonic perforation are lacking.",
