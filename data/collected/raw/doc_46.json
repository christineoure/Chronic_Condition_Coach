  "title": "Singing for lung health following completion of pulmonary rehabilitation: feasibility of a randomised controlled trial.",
  "abstract": "Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is a highly effective intervention for people with chronic respiratory disease; however, it is not known how best to sustain its benefits. Clinical trials are needed to establish if participation in singing for lung health (SLH) groups following PR will improve health-related quality of life, healthcare utilisation and exercise capacity compared with usual care. A feasibility study would help to guide development of these trials.",
