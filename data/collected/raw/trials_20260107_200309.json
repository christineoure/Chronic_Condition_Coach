    "summary": "In this observational study, data from the recent past of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease will be studied.\n\nType 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a condition in which the body does not make enough of a hormone called insulin or does not use insulin well. This results in high blood sugar levels. About half of people with T2DM also have a condition called chronic kidney disease (CKD). In people with CKD, the kidneys' ability to work as how it should decreases over time.\n\nIn this study, researchers want to learn more about the CKD in T2DM patients in Alberta, Canada. This will help them to know the chances to improve the care of these patients.\n\nThe researchers will look at the health information from adult men and women in Alberta who were diagnosed with T2DM before 2018 and visited a doctor to have check-ups in 2018. They will find out about how many of these people had CKD and how severe their CKD was. The researchers will collect data about the age and gender of these patients, how long they had T2DM and if they had other related medical problems. The researchers will also learn how these patients were treated based on their kidney condition and how much money was spent on these treatments.\n\nThis study will collect information from the health records of about 270,000 patients with T2DM who were living in Alberta, Canada. This information will come from the Alberta Kidney Disease Network (AKDN) database. Besides this data collection, no further tests or examinations are planned in this study.",

This leads to an overestimation of insulin required for a patient who consumes a portion of mainly proteins and fats on their trays or an underestimation for those eating mainly the carbohydrates on their tray. Low sugars or high blood sugars can follow respectively.\n\nHypothesis: The purpose of this study is to see if dosing meal-time insulin based on grams of carbohydrates consumed will result in better sugar control compared to the usual practice of dosing meal-time insulin based on percent of total meal consumed in hospitalized patients.",

Globally the prevalence of HTN is over 25% for adults, and accounts for approximately 13.5% of all deaths. Given the aging of the population together with increases in obesity and sedentary behavior, it is not surprising that HTN is projected to increase significantly over the next several decades; with over 1.5 billion adults having HTN by the year 2025. Thus the public health implications to preventing and/or reducing elevations in blood pressure are substantial.\n\nThis study compares the efficacy of two different non-pharmacologic interventions (device guided breathing and isometric hand grip exercises) used alone and in combination for lowering blood pressure. This pilot study will include 30 adults with stage 1 hypertension. The primary outcome is the change in blood pressure from baseline to 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes include change in blood pressure from 8 weeks to 16 weeks and acceptability of the interventions by participants. The knowledge gained from this study can provide information on non-pharmacologic methods that may be useful in decreasing blood pressure. Such knowledge may be especially useful for patients for whom access to medications and health care is limited and among patients unwilling to take or intolerant to pharmacologic therapies.",

Assess and build setting, community, and user fit of DESA, leveraging qualitative methods and simulation telehealth encounters between the patient and neurologist.\n2. Conduct a 9-month pilot randomized control trial (RCT) of DESA in a Central Brooklyn stroke population to examine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy. We will randomize 50 adults to DESA and 30 to usual care. The primary outcome will be BP control. Secondary outcomes include the number of BP measurements and medication compliance. Our primary hypothesis is that patients randomized to the DESA will significantly reduce systolic blood pressure at 9 months.\n3. Examine barriers and facilitators to the adoption and integration of DESA into routine stroke care utilizing key informant interviews and user satisfaction surveys with neurologists and intervention participants.",

Dextrose prolotherapy has also been found to provide periarticular benefits for knee osteoarthritis. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided perimeniscal corticosteroid and perimeniscal dextrose injections in patients with osteoarthritis, medial knee pain, and medial meniscal extrusion.\n\nMethod: Patients with medial knee pain and meniscal extrusion were randomly divided into two groups using the double-block randomization method. Group 1 included 15 patients who were administered an ultrasound-guided perimeniscal steroid injection, while Group 2 included 16 patients who were administered an ultrasound-guided perimeniscal dextrose injection. The patients' pain levels were evaluated using the Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS) and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) before and one week, one month, and three months after the injection.",

    "summary": "There is a potential link between diabetes mellitus (DM) and severity of osteoarthritis .Type 2 diabetes is a part of the metabolic syndrome (Mets) accompanied by ageing and mechanical stress are also a risk factor to osteoarthritis. Every anatomical component of the joint demonstrated faster joint deterioration and elevated inflammation at microcellular environment of individuals with DM. Normal chondrocytes capacity to adapt to the local glucose level is impaired by OA and there is a significant risk of glucose toxicity and increased glucose absorption. The most dependable and effective treatment for mild to early joint osteoarthritis is exercise. Active free exercises i.e. Buerger Allen exercises are used as a conservative perfusion therapy because they rely on how gravity affects the smooth muscles in the valves. Synovial fluid supports the joint's ability to recover while also reducing inflammation and enhancing overall joint function. The aim of the study is to determine the effect of Buerger Allen exercise and low intensity high repetition exercises on pain, range of motion and disability in knee osteoarthritis with type 2 diabetes. The study would be randomized controlled trial. Total thirty-six subjects will be assigned randomly by using lottery randomization into two groups. Group A will receive conventional therapy and an additional Buerger Allen exercise while Group B will be a control group receiving only baseline treatment. Numeric pain rating scale (NPRS), Ankle Brachial Index, KOOS and Goniometer will be used as outcome measure tools for pain, range of motion and disability. Measure will be taken at baseline and at the end of treatment session. The collected data will be analyzed in Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 25.0.If data will be normally distributed then parametric if not normally distributed than non-parametric",

The Telemedicine Enhanced Asthma Management-Uniting Providers (TEAM-UP) program enhances a school-based, primary care directed asthma program with specialist-supported care to ensure optimal guideline based treatment. This study is a full-scale randomized trial of TEAM-UP versus an enhanced care comparison group. Primary care physicians (PCP) of all enrolled children (n=360, 4-12 yrs.) will be prompted to initiate directly observed therapy (DOT) of preventive asthma medication through school and to make a specialist referral. For children in the TEAM-UP group, the specialist visits will be facilitated via telemedicine at school. The telemedicine specialist visit will be scheduled after approximately 4 weeks of initiating DOT, in order to allow for accurate guideline-based assessments of medication and care needs once adherence with a daily controller medication is established. There will also be up to 2 telemedicine follow-up specialist visits to assess the child's response to treatment and make needed adjustments. The study will use the existing community infrastructure by implementing both telemedicine and DOT in school, and maintaining collaboration with PCPs. Blinded follow-ups will occur at 3-, 5-, 7- and 12-months after baseline, and the primary outcome is the comparison of symptom-free days (SFD) at each follow-up time point.",
