  "title": "Managing and modifying the risk factors in an older adult with multiple chronic medical conditions.",
  "abstract": "This case describes a man in his 70s with multiple chronic medical conditions who faced growing challenges in daily self-care, particularly with mobility and eating, which contributed to increased social isolation. While he strongly valued his independence and wished to continue everyday activities, he needed accessible and comprehensible feedback about his daily health behaviours and lifestyle. We describe the use of a self-management tool, a mobile health application (app) designed to support his healthy lifestyle. The app enabled monitoring of his daily activities and provided rewards for goal setting and the achievement of positive health. This case report adds to the growing body of literature on how technological aids may assist ageing populations with chronic medical needs.",
