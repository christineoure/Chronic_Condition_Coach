    "title": "Eligible but Untreated: Gaps in Statin Therapy for Type 1 Diabetes Under the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Guidelines.",
    "abstract": "Background and objective\u00a0 Cardiovascular disease (CVD) represents a principal contributor to premature morbidity and mortality in individuals with type\u202f1\u202fdiabetes mellitus (T1DM). Effective lipid management, including the use of statin therapy, offers substantial potential to mitigate long\u2011term vascular risk, particularly among patients with established microvascular complications or long disease duration. This study aimed to assess the extent to which statin prescribing practices in a large healthcare trust align with the current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines. Methods We performed a retrospective review of electronic health records for T1DM patients under the care of a single healthcare trust. Patients were stratified into two groups based on age: \u226540 years and <40 years. According to NICE criteria, statin therapy is indicated for patients aged \u226540 years, or those of any age with diabetes duration >10 years, diabetic nephropathy, or other modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. The main outcome measure was the proportion of eligible patients who had been prescribed statin therapy. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results Among 1,229 patients aged \u226540 years, 896\u202f(73%) were receiving statins, leaving 333\u202f(27%) without therapy despite being eligible. In the <40\u202fyears age group, 192 patients met NICE indications for statin use. Prescription rates were notably lower in this cohort: six\u202f(35%) for those with nephropathy, 2two(15%) among those with retinopathy, and 75\u202f(47%) for patients with both risk factors. Overall, only 83\u202f(43%) of eligible patients under 40 were prescribed statins. Conclusions Our findings reveal a significant gap between guideline recommendations and real-world prescribing patterns, particularly among younger T1DM patients with additional CVD risk factors. Given the elevated cardiovascular risk in this population, strategies to enhance clinician awareness and improve adherence to NICE guidance are urgently needed to optimize primary prevention.",

    "title": "Practical approach to the management of diabetic cardiomyopathy: From molecular pathways to treatment strategies.",
    "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) has emerged as a major health challenge, further intensified by the rising global prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It plays a key role in the morbidity and mortality linked to diabetes, mainly through myocardial dysfunction that develops independently of coronary artery disease or hypertensive heart disease and is a major contributor to heart failure. Despite the significance of DCM, there is no gold standard diagnostic test; rather, a multimodal approach is required that includes clinical evaluation (risk factors, and symptoms and signs), cardiac imaging techniques, and biomarkers. The integrationof all evaluations may ultimately allow for earlier identification and improved outcomes through timely intervention. In addition, there is scarce evidence on treatment of DCM. The conventional treatment approach is primarily focused on achieving glycemic control, managing cardiac dysfunction, and reducing cardiovascular events using therapies extrapolated from diabetes and heart failure guidelines, rather than targeting the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. On the other hand, beyond pharmacological approaches, lifestyle modifications, particularly exercise and dietary interventions, could play an important role in the management of DCM due to the associated cardiometabolic benefits in patients with diabetes. In this review, due to the urgent need of clarification for the specific management of DCM and the lack of consistent evidence, we provide a practical updated overview from the pathophysiology to current and future treatment strategies. By integrating this knowledge, we aim to summarize the diagnosis and therapeutic approach that could effectively mitigate or prevent the progression of DCM.",

    "title": "Modulation of PDX1 gene expression and glycemic control by Citrullus lanatus in experimental type 2 diabetes.",
    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a major global health burden characterized by hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, and progressive pancreatic \u03b2-cell dysfunction. Despite the availability of conventional therapies, the need for safer and more effective alternatives persists. Citrullus lanatus (African watermelon) is a fruit rich in bioactive compounds with reported antihyperglycemic and antioxidant properties. This study investigated the modulatory effects of C. lanatus juice on pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1) gene expression and glycemic control in fortified-diet-fed streptozotocin-induced diabetic Wistar rats. Thirty-six rats weighing 90-110\u00a0g, were randomized into six groups: normal control (NMC), diabetic control (DBC), metformin-treated diabetic rats (DBM, 500\u00a0mg/kg), and diabetic rats treated with C. lanatus juice at 200\u00a0mg/kg (DBCL1), 500\u00a0mg/kg (DBCL2), and 1000\u00a0mg/kg (DBCL3). Animals were pre-fed either normal or fortified diets prior to diabetes induction with streptozotocin (35\u00a0mg/kg). Following 14 days of treatment, blood and pancreatic tissues were analyzed for glycemic, antioxidant, and molecular parameters. C. lanatus juice significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.05) reduced fasting blood glucose in a dose-dependent manner, with the greatest effect observed in DBCL3. Antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase) were significantly increased, while malondialdehyde levels were reduced in all treated groups. Notably, PDX1 gene expression was markedly upregulated (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in C. lanatus-treated rats, accompanied by improved insulin, C-peptide, and HDL levels. These findings suggest that C. lanatus juice exerts antidiabetic effects that are associated with increased PDX1 mRNA expression, improved glycemic control, and reduced oxidative stress, supporting a potential role for transcriptional modulation of \u03b2-cell function, highlighting its potential as a functional dietary intervention for type 2 diabetes management.",

    "title": "Subgroup analysis of genotype guided vs traditional warfarin dosing in Asian patients from an open label randomized trial.",
    "abstract": "Genotype-guided warfarin dosing has shown improved anticoagulation outcomes in individuals of European and Asian ancestry. However, its usefulness in specific subgroups remains uncertain. This open-label, non-inferiority randomized trial (NCT00700895) was conducted across three academic hospitals in Southeast Asia to assess the utility of genotype-guided warfarin dosing in Asian patients, focusing on specific potentially high-risk subgroups. We enrolled 322 newly initiated warfarin patients. The primary endpoint was the number of dose adjustments within the first 14\u00a0days of treatment, with a non-inferiority margin of 0.5. Clinical follow-up lasted 90\u00a0days. Among 322 randomized patients, 269 (mean age 58.7\u00a0years, 59.9% males) were evaluated for the primary endpoint. The pharmacogenetic algorithm significantly reduced dose titrations during the initial 14\u00a0days compared to the traditional dosing algorithm, without compromising safety. This benefit was consistent in those with atrial fibrillation (N\u2009=\u2009101, mean difference -1.63, 95% CI -2.16 to -1.10), non-atrial fibrillation indications (N\u2009=\u2009165, mean difference -0.88, 95% CI -1.26 to -0.49), stroke-only indications (N\u2009=\u200919, mean difference -1.60, 95% CI -2.83 to -0.37), history of acute myocardial infarction (N\u2009=\u200920), congestive heart failure (N\u2009=\u200934), hypertension (N\u2009=\u2009152), diabetes mellitus (N\u2009=\u200995), and across races (Chinese, N\u2009=\u2009163; Malay, Indian and Others, N\u2009=\u2009104), sexes (female, N\u2009=\u2009161 and male, N\u2009=\u2009108), and age groups (<\u200965\u00a0years, N\u2009=\u2009168 and\u2009\u2265\u200965\u00a0years, N\u2009=\u2009101). However, no significant reduction was observed in patients with a history of stroke. There were no differences in minor or major bleeding complications, recurrent venous thromboembolism, or out-of-range INR measurements across most subgroups. Healthcare providers may consider using pharmacogenetic algorithms to individualize initial warfarin dosages in specific high risk Asian subpopulations.

    "title": "Concurrent diabetes and heart failure: revisiting epidemiological and clinicopathological interplay.",
    "abstract": "The global prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) and heart failure (HF) is rapidly increasing. Hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress in people with DM are the key etiological factors of HF. The factors disrupt systemic, myocardial and cellular mechanisms, leading to lipotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, altered calcium signaling and inflammation, ultimately resulting in HF. Heart failure on the other hand induces new-onset diabetes by modulating insulin signaling. Despite the availability of novel treatment approaches, these comorbid conditions continue to increase hospitalization, treatment expenditure and mortality. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the complex bidirectional relationship between DM and HF might be helpful in managing the associated complications of both conditions. This review aims to provide an overview of cellular and pathophysiological interplay of the glucovascular continuum from DM to HF, and vice versa. Additionally, updated estimates on prevalence and outcomes of incident HF in people with DM and new-onset DM after HF are discussed. Guidelines from the United States, Europe and Korea recommended sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) for primary prevention of DM and HF, and for reduction of HF hospitalization. Evidences from large-scale clinical trials and meta-analyses have shown that SGLT2i (empagliflozin, canagliflozin and dapagliflozin), semaglutide (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist) and finerenone (mineralcorticoid receptor antagonist) act as effective anti-diabetic agents and provide cardiovascular protection. Future research should prioritize diabetic control to manage and prevent lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, inflammation and advanced glycation end-product formation in order to diminish the disease burden.",

    "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) poses an important worldwide health challenge, impacting over 400 million individuals globally. It ranks as the seventh most common reason for mortality. Among its forms, T2DM is the most widespread, accounting for close to 90.0% of all identified cases. Recognized as a critical chronic health issue, Type 2 diabetes contributes to early morbidity, heart-related conditions and various other health complications. Over the last two decades, advancements in medical science have introduced novel medications to manage high levels of blood sugar in T2DM. Alongside these developments, updated clinical guidelines now emphasize strict glucose management in the initial phases of the condition. This has complicated the selection of appropriate medications, leading to significant shifts in prescription trends, with notable differences observed across nations based on available treatment options. The study aimed to judge the various categories of oral diabetes medications used at the start of therapy, the prevalence of single-drug versus multi-drug approaches and the average count of medications suggested per patient visit. This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Department of Pharmacology in collaboration with the Department of Endocrinology Outpatients' Department in Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (MMCH), Mymensingh, Bangladesh. The mostfrequently used single drug is metformin (38.92%) and the most generally used combination therapy is Sulfonylurea + Biguanides + DPP4 inhibitor (44.77%). It is concluded that in T2DM cases, metformin was the most usually used drug both in initial drug treatment and as a single drug treatment. Sulfonylurea + Biguanides + DPP4 inhibitor was the most common blend therapy for T2DM.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus includes a wide range of chronic metabolic disorders that result in severe hyperglycemia and other damages in diabetic patients due to impaired insulin secretion or insulin inefficiency. This study purpose was to consider of the potential therapeutic properties of MSCs-derived EVs/Exo against DM. A complete systematic search was achieved in various electronic databases (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed and Embase) up to June 2025, following the PRISMA guidelines. A whole of 89 studies were screened based on predetermined standards for inclusion and exclusion. Eventually, the current systematic study contained 13 publications that had the criteria of inclusion. According to the findings of this study, MSCs-derived EVs/Exo reduce DM and hyperglycemia with the high ability to regulate inflammatory-immune responses and activate autophagy pathways. However, compared to the diabetic groups, treatment with MSCs-derived EVs/Exo revealed tendency towards immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, regeneration and neogenesis of \u03b2-islets. In other studies, have been identified that DM causes significant biochemical changes in beta cells/pancreas tissue. In addition, obvious histological changes were observed in pancreatic tissue following DM. Generally, MSCs-derived EVs/Exo administration modulated most of the histological and biochemical changes caused by diabetes. Notably, the DM is improved through recovering damaged tissues, increasing insulin levels and glycemic stability. It seems that, MSCs-derived EVs/Exo exert these protective and therapeutic properties through the modulating of multiple mechanisms that are implicated in DM.",

    "title": "Practical approach to the management of diabetic cardiomyopathy: From molecular pathways to treatment strategies.",
    "abstract": "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) has emerged as a major health challenge, further intensified by the rising global prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It plays a key role in the morbidity and mortality linked to diabetes, mainly through myocardial dysfunction that develops independently of coronary artery disease or hypertensive heart disease and is a major contributor to heart failure. Despite the significance of DCM, there is no gold standard diagnostic test; rather, a multimodal approach is required that includes clinical evaluation (risk factors, and symptoms and signs), cardiac imaging techniques, and biomarkers. The integrationof all evaluations may ultimately allow for earlier identification and improved outcomes through timely intervention. In addition, there is scarce evidence on treatment of DCM. The conventional treatment approach is primarily focused on achieving glycemic control, managing cardiac dysfunction, and reducing cardiovascular events using therapies extrapolated from diabetes and heart failure guidelines, rather than targeting the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. On the other hand, beyond pharmacological approaches, lifestyle modifications, particularly exercise and dietary interventions, could play an important role in the management of DCM due to the associated cardiometabolic benefits in patients with diabetes. In this review, due to the urgent need of clarification for the specific management of DCM and the lack of consistent evidence, we provide a practical updated overview from the pathophysiology to current and future treatment strategies. By integrating this knowledge, we aim to summarize the diagnosis and therapeutic approach that could effectively mitigate or prevent the progression of DCM.",

    "abstract": "Growing evidence on the long-term efficacy and safety of sympathetic renal denervation (RDN) has established this neuromodulatory interventional therapy as the third therapeutic pillar for hypertension management, alongside lifestyle modification and pharmacotherapy. Accordingly, recent European and American guidelines have upgraded the role of RDN, recommending its consideration as an additional treatment option for selected patients with resistant or uncontrolled hypertension - particularly for those at high cardiovascular risk - when performed in experienced centers with appropriate training and within a shared decision-making framework that respects patients' preferences. This consensus document, jointly developed by the Hellenic Society of Hypertension (Hellenic Excellence Centers of Hypertension), the Hellenic Society of Cardiology (Working Groups \"Hypertension and Heart\" and \"Interventional Cardiology\"), the Hellenic Society of Nephrology, and the Hellenic Academy of General Practice/Family Medicine and Primary Health Care, aims to provide a structured referral pathway for the clinical use of RDN in Greece. The proposed pathway integrates all contemporary therapeutic options in alignment with current hypertension guidelines and takes into account the structure of the Greek healthcare system. Ongoing and future research regarding antihypertensive therapies, including novel device-based and pharmacological interventions, is anticipated to further refine patient selection, procedural techniques, and long-term strategies to optimize cardiometabolic outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Genotype-guided warfarin dosing has shown improved anticoagulation outcomes in individuals of European and Asian ancestry. However, its usefulness in specific subgroups remains uncertain. This open-label, non-inferiority randomized trial (NCT00700895) was conducted across three academic hospitals in Southeast Asia to assess the utility of genotype-guided warfarin dosing in Asian patients, focusing on specific potentially high-risk subgroups. We enrolled 322 newly initiated warfarin patients. The primary endpoint was the number of dose adjustments within the first 14\u00a0days of treatment, with a non-inferiority margin of 0.5. Clinical follow-up lasted 90\u00a0days. Among 322 randomized patients, 269 (mean age 58.7\u00a0years, 59.9% males) were evaluated for the primary endpoint. The pharmacogenetic algorithm significantly reduced dose titrations during the initial 14\u00a0days compared to the traditional dosing algorithm, without compromising safety. This benefit was consistent in those with atrial fibrillation (N\u2009=\u2009101, mean difference -1.63, 95% CI -2.16 to -1.10), non-atrial fibrillation indications (N\u2009=\u2009165, mean difference -0.88, 95% CI -1.26 to -0.49), stroke-only indications (N\u2009=\u200919, mean difference -1.60, 95% CI -2.83 to -0.37), history of acute myocardial infarction (N\u2009=\u200920), congestive heart failure (N\u2009=\u200934), hypertension (N\u2009=\u2009152), diabetes mellitus (N\u2009=\u200995), and across races (Chinese, N\u2009=\u2009163; Malay, Indian and Others, N\u2009=\u2009104), sexes (female, N\u2009=\u2009161 and male, N\u2009=\u2009108), and age groups (<\u200965\u00a0years, N\u2009=\u2009168 and\u2009\u2265\u200965\u00a0years, N\u2009=\u2009101). However, no significant reduction was observed in patients with a history of stroke. There were no differences in minor or major bleeding complications, recurrent venous thromboembolism, or out-of-range INR measurements across most subgroups. Healthcare providers may consider using pharmacogenetic algorithms to individualize initial warfarin dosages in specific high risk Asian subpopulations.

    "abstract": "Anticoagulation is typically withheld in cases of severe thrombocytopenia, but clinical decision-making becomes challenging when a patient has multiple established venous and arterial thrombogenic risk factors, along with a fluctuating platelet level. Given the absence of clear guidelines and with an uncertain balance of risks and benefits, this case report and the accompanying discussion may offer useful insights for managing similar situations in the future. A 70\u2011year\u2011old male with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung presented to the emergency department\u00a0for evaluation of worsening fatigue and weakness, which had led to a presyncopal episode with a ground-level fall. His cancer had been diagnosed one year prior and treated monthly with radiation, chemo, and immunotherapies. On admission, he was hypotensive, tachycardic, febrile, and markedly pancytopenic. CT imaging suggested pneumonia superimposed on an extensive tumor burden. He was also found to have new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) with a rapid ventricular rate. This was initially rate-controlled with labetalol, but anticoagulation was held due to thrombocytopenia, despite a CHADS\u2082/VASc score of 2.\u00a0He was transferred to the ICU for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and septic shock complicated by pancytopenia and neutropenic fever. The patient was treated with broad\u2011spectrum antibiotics, steroids, filgrastim, vasopressors, intubation, and multiple transfusions (three units of platelets and one unit of packed red blood cells) during the first three days of his five-day admission. Platelet counts ranged between 11 and 61 \u00d7 10\u00b3/\u00b5L despite interventions.\u00a0On day three, blood cultures grew Pseudomonas; antibiotics were narrowed, and he was successfully extubated to bilevel positive airway pressure. By day four, his atrial fibrillation converted to sinus rhythm for the first time during this admission, and digoxin was initiated due to ongoing hypotension. Subsequently, he developed a complicated pleural effusion that required chest tube placement. Unfortunately, on day five of admission, he exhibited ST\u2011segment elevations (V2-V6) consistent with anterior myocardial infarction. Due to thrombocytopenia, comorbidities, and goals of care, anticoagulation and reperfusion interventions were deferred. Care transitioned to comfort measures only, and he died 48\u202fhours later. This report highlights a unique instance of a common clinical dilemma: determining whether to initiate or withhold anticoagulation in a thrombocytopenic patient with multiple high-risk prothrombotic factors. To our knowledge, no established guidelines specifically address the complex overlap of severe, fluctuating thrombocytopenia and elevated thrombotic risk. This report also\u00a0underscores the importance of individualized clinical judgment and continual reassessment when making anticoagulation decisions.",

    "abstract": "Dysphagia is a global health problem and one of the complications of COPD. It has a negative impact on health status and can reduce patients' ability to perform activities of daily living as well as their quality of life. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the effects of diverse health education based on the teach-back method on the health status, activities of daily living, and quality of life of dysphagia in elderly patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Elderly COPD patients who received inpatient treatment at a tertiary hospital in Yunnan, China, from November 2022 to September 2023 were selected and screened for combined dysphagia using the Kubota drinking water test. The control group was provided with routine care, and the intervention group added diversified health education based on the teach-back method on top of routine care. After 12\u00a0days of intervention, the results of health status, quality of life and activities of daily living were compared between the two groups. Research data shows that in terms of the proportion of patients in the two groups, 86.7% are male and 13.3% are female. The proportion is 23.3% for those aged 60-69, 48.9% for those aged 70-79, and 27.8% for those aged 80 and above. The proportion of those who could concentrate on eating was 15.6%, and those who could not concentrate on eating was 84.4%. The proportion of those who need to eat within 30\u00a0min is 61.1%, and that who need to eat within 30\u00a0min is 38.9%. The proportion of comorbidities with less than two diseases was 26.7%, and that with two or more diseases was 73.3%.The general demographic data of the two groups were compared, and the differences were not statistically significant (P\u2009>\u20090.05) and were comparable; the health status score of the intervention group (19.56\u2009\u00b1\u20095.05) showed a significant downward trend compared with the control group (23.38\u2009\u00b1\u20096.70) (P\u2009<\u20090.05); the ability to carry out activities of daily living in the intervention group (82.89\u2009\u00b1\u200919.20) was scored as showing a significant upward trend compared with the control group (68.78\u2009\u00b1\u200925.00) (P\u2009<\u20090.05); and the psychological burden on the quality of life of patients in the two groups, Eating time, desire to eat, food choice, verbal communication, fear, mental health, social interaction, sleep and fatigue in both groups (P\u2009<\u20090.05), however, symptom frequency was rated lower than that of the control group (P\u2009>\u20090.05). Diversified health education based on the teach-back method was used to intervene in the health status, ability to perform activities of daily living, and quality of life of dysphagia in elderly patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Compared with conventional care, the program was effective in improving patients' health status, activities of daily living, and quality of life.Trial registration: The trial was registered with the China Clinical Trial Registry and is available at the China Clinical Trial Registry (www.chictr.org.cn).

Chronic diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, heart\u00a0failure, and liver cirrhosis have documented risk factors, and guidelines are being continuously developed for reducing readmissions. Despite advancements, readmission patterns in some chronic conditions still remain underexplored. Recurrent hospitalizations among inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients may reflect disease severity, frequency of complications, and inadequate outpatient management, which can negatively impact quality of life and increase financial strain on healthcare systems.

    "abstract": "Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic, progressive respiratory condition characterized by airflow limitation, frequent exacerbations, and substantial impact on quality of life and healthcare utilization. Effective management requires adherence to standardized international guidelines to optimize outcomes. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the management of COPD patients in accordance with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) recommendations, with particular emphasis on the appropriateness of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions relative to disease severity and risk classification. Methods This retrospective study included 350 COPD patients, confirmed by spirometry, conducted at Jinnah Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan, from January 2022 to January 2025. Data were collected from hospital records, including demographics, smoking status, comorbidities, spirometry results, GOLD classification, treatment regimens, exacerbation frequency, and non-pharmacological interventions. Patients were categorized into GOLD ABE groups based on symptom burden and exacerbation history. Results The mean age of patients was 61.4 \u00b1 9.8 years, with a male predominance of 218 (62.3%). Smoking history was present in 272 (77.7%) patients, while 64 (18.3%) reported biomass exposure. Most patients had advanced disease, with 256 (73.1%) in GOLD 3-4 stages and 173 (49.4%) classified as GOLD Group E. The mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (%) predicted was 48.7 \u00b1 13.4. Exacerbation burden was high, with 108 (30.9%) patients reporting \u22652 exacerbations annually and 98 (28.0%) requiring hospitalization. Pharmacological management showed that 142 (40.6%) patients received dual therapy (long-acting\u00a0muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) + long-acting beta 2-agonist (LABA)) and 128 (36.6%) received triple therapy (inhaled corticosteroid or ICS + LABA + LAMA). Non-pharmacological measures were variably implemented: smoking cessation counseling was documented in 320 (91.4%) patients, though only 114 (35.6%) achieved abstinence; influenza and pneumococcal vaccination coverage was 122 (34.9%) and 88 (25.1%) patients, respectively; and pulmonary rehabilitation was accessed by 96 (27.4%). Conclusion It is concluded that while pharmacological treatment in COPD patients largely followed GOLD guidelines, significant deficiencies were observed in the adoption of non-pharmacological interventions, vaccination, and early disease detection.",

    "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous chronic lung condition often accompanied by comorbidities and systemic manifestations that affect the person's clinical condition and prognosis and often require specific treatment. Therefore, the management of COPD extends beyond treatment for the lungs per se. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) should be considered as part of person-centered management, and supervised exercise training is a core component of this intervention. PR exercise training parameters (e.g., frequency, intensity, time, and type) should be individualized to maximize each individual's functional gains while targeting systemic manifestations and comorbidities. This manuscript presents evidence-based tailored recommendations for optimizing exercise interventions for people with COPD and comorbidities that significantly affect prognosis (e.g., mortality, hospitalizations) including cardiovascular disease (CVD) (e.g., chronic coronary syndrome, heart failure), CVD risk factors (e.g., type 2 diabetes mellitus [T2DM], hypertension), and sarcopenia. To achieve these goals, existing guidelines and evidence for exercise training in COPD, CVD, CVD risk factors, and sarcopenia have been reviewed to identify synergies between PR and cardiac rehabilitation, as well as the treatment of T2DM and sarcopenia. In addition, we provided clinical cases to illustrate how PR can be adapted to accommodate specific comorbidities. These examples offer practical guidance for tailoring exercise prescriptions within PR programs to address the unique needs of people with COPD and clinically relevant comorbidities, thereby enhancing overall treatment effectiveness and optimizing health outcomes.",
