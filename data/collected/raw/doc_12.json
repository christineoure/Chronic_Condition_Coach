  "title": "Basic needs navigation intervention to address multidimensional adversity in African Americans with diabetic kidney disease: A pilot randomized clinical trial protocol.",
  "abstract": "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of end stage kidney disease (ESKD) in the United States. African Americans have a risk of developing chronic kidney disease and are almost four times more likely to progress to ESKD compared to non-Hispanic whites. The presence of social adversities impacts the complex self-management of DKD and negatively impacts health outcomes. Patient navigation interventions offer a promising strategy to improve health outcomes in individuals with chronic disease. However, it is not known whether a basic needs navigation intervention that addresses social adversities in combination with patient education and lifestyle coaching leads to improved clinical and patient-centered outcomes.",
