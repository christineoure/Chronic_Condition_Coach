  "title": "Population Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Modeling to Support Molar Dose Ratio Determination of Long-Acting Insulin Analogs.",
  "abstract": "INS068 is a new soluble, long-acting insulin analog intended to cover basal insulin requirements in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The purpose of this study was to determine the molar dose ratio of INS068 to insulin degludec (IDeg) by comparing the clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles of INS068 and IDeg. The PD endpoints include glucose infusion rate (GIR) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c).",
