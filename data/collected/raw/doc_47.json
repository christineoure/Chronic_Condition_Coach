  "title": "Estimating Breathing Reserve at Peak Treadmill Exercise: Influence of Sex and Fitness.",
  "abstract": "A low breathing reserve (peak ventilation [Epeak]/estimated maximum ventilation [Emax] \u2264 15%) is recommended as the decision node to indicate abnormal ventilatory limitation during incremental cycle ergometry. Given higher Epeak during weight-bearing exercise, we aim to establish which coefficients should multiply the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to reduce the prevalence of a low breathing reserve in healthy subjects undergoing treadmill exercise.",
