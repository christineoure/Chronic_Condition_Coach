  "title": "The prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in high-altitude areas of China: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "China is one of the countries with the heaviest burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In high-altitude areas of China (\u22651,500 m), factors such as low oxygen levels, burning of biomass, and an aging population make the prevention and treatment of COPD more challenging. However, there is currently a lack of systematic epidemiological studies. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of COPD in high-altitude areas of China.",
