  "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) imposes a substantial clinical and economic burden in Colombia, particularly among older adults. Despite widespread use of dual therapy, many patients remain at high risk of exacerbations. Our objective was to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of single-inhaler triple therapy (FF/UMEC/VI) versus dual therapy (FF/VI) in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD in Colombia.",
