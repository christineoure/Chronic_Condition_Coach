  "conditions": [
    "Severe Eosinophilic Asthma"
  ],

  "phase": "N/A",
  "summary": "Understanding how Interleukin-5 blockade modulates both immune and metabolic pathways may clarify the multidimensional impact of biologic therapy in severe eosinophilic asthma. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the impact of mepolizumab on the nasal, bronchial, and systemic metabolomic profiles of consecutive patients with SEA and to explore the associations between these compartment-specific changes and clinical, inflammatory, and functional outcomes.",
