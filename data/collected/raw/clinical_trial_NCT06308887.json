  "summary": "Introduction: The primary goal of treating knee osteoarthritis is to reduce pain and improve the patient's quality of life. Medial meniscal extrusion is a condition that is linked to pain and disability in knee osteoarthritis and can be identified through ultrasound. For patients with medial meniscal extrusion, perimeniscal corticosteroid injection has been shown to be a helpful addition to primary treatment for moderate to severe pain relief. Dextrose prolotherapy has also been found to provide periarticular benefits for knee osteoarthritis. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided perimeniscal corticosteroid and perimeniscal dextrose injections in patients with osteoarthritis, medial knee pain, and medial meniscal extrusion.\n\nMethod: Patients with medial knee pain and meniscal extrusion were randomly divided into two groups using the double-block randomization method. Group 1 included 15 patients who were administered an ultrasound-guided perimeniscal steroid injection, while Group 2 included 16 patients who were administered an ultrasound-guided perimeniscal dextrose injection. The patients' pain levels were evaluated using the Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS) and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) before and one week, one month, and three months after the injection.",
