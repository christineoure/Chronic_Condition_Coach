    "content": "Noncommunicable diseases 25 September 2025 Key factsNoncommunicable diseases (NCDs) killed at least 43 million people in 2021, equivalent to 75% of non-pandemic-related deaths globally.In 2021, 18 million people died from an NCD before age 70 years; 82% of these premature deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries.Of all NCD deaths, 73% are in low- and middle-income countries.Cardiovascular diseases account for most NCD deaths, or at least 19 million deaths in 2021, followed by cancers (10 million), chronic respiratory diseases (4 million), and diabetes (over 2 million including kidney disease deaths caused by diabetes).These four groups of diseases account for 80% of all premature NCD deaths.Tobacco use, physical inactivity, the harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diets and air pollution all increase the risk of dying from an NCD.Detection, screening and treatment of NCDs, as well as palliative care, are key components of the response to NCDs.OverviewNoncommunicable diseases (NCDs), also known as chronic diseases, tend to be of long duration and are the result of a combination of genetic, physiological, environmental and behavioural factors.The main types of NCDs are cardiovascular diseases (such as heart attacks and stroke), cancers, chronic respiratory diseases (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma) and diabetes.NCDs disproportionately affect people in low- and middle-income countries, where nearly three quarters of global NCD deaths (32 million) occur.People at riskPeople of all age groups, regions and countries are affected by NCDs. These conditions are often associated with older age groups, but about 18 million NCD deaths occur before the age of 70 years. NCDs cause more deaths in this age group than all other causes of death combined. Of these premature deaths, 82% are estimated to occur in low- and middle-income countries. Children, adults and the elderly are all vulnerable to the risk factors contributing to NCDs, whether from unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, exposure to tobacco smoke, or the harmful use of alcohol or air pollution.Unhealthy diets and a lack of physical activity may show up in people as raised blood pressure, increased blood glucose, elevated blood lipids and obesity. These are called metabolic risk factors and can lead to cardiovascular disease, the leading NCD in terms of premature deaths.Risk factorsBehavioural risk factorsBehavioural risk factors increase the risk of NCDS, including:tobacco use (including the effects of exposure to second-hand smoke);unhealthy diets, including excess salt, sugar, and fats;harmful use of alcohol; andinsufficient physical activity.The social, commercial, and physical environment are key drivers of these behaviours.Metabolic risk factorsBehavioural risk factors contribute to four key metabolic changes that increase the risk of NCDs:raised blood pressure (including hypertension);overweight/obesity;high blood glucose levels (including diabetes); andabnormal blood lipids (including high cholesterol).In terms of attributable deaths, the leading metabolic risk factor globally is elevated blood pressure (to which 25% of global NCD deaths are attributed) (1), followed by raised blood glucose and overweight and obesity.Environmental risk factorsSeveral environmental risk factors contribute to NCDs. Air pollution \u2013 indoor and outdoor \u2013 is the largest of these, accounting for 6.7 million deaths globally, of which about 5.6 million are due to NCDs, including stroke, ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lung cancer.Socioeconomic impactNCDs threaten progress towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which includes a target of reducing the probability of death from any of the four main NCDs between ages 30 and 70 years by one third by 2030.Poverty is closely linked with NCDs. The rapid rise in NCDs is predicted to impede poverty reduction initiatives in low-income countries, particularly by increasing household costs associated with health care. Vulnerable and socially disadvantaged people get sicker and die sooner than people of higher socio-economic positions, especially because they may have limited access to health services. To reduce these inequities, governments must invest in health systems that respond to users\u2019 expectations and needs.Prevention and controlAn important way to control NCDs is to focus on reducing the risk factors associated with these diseases. Low-cost solutions exist for governments and other stakeholders to reduce the common modifiable risk factors. Monitoring progress and trends of NCDs and their risk is important for guiding policy and priorities.To lessen the impact of NCDs on individuals and society, a comprehensive approach is needed requiring all sectors, including health, finance, transport, education, agriculture, planning and others, to collaborate to reduce the risks associated with NCDs, and to promote interventions to prevent and control them.Investing in better management of NCDs is critical. Management of NCDs includes detecting, screening and treating these diseases, and providing access to palliative care for people in need. High impact essential NCD interventions can be delivered through a primary health care approach to strengthen early detection and timely treatment. Evidence shows such interventions are excellent economic investments because, if provided early to patients, they can reduce the need for more expensive treatment. Countries with inadequate health care coverage are unlikely to provide universal access to essential NCD interventions. NCD management interventions are essential for achieving the SDG target on NCDs.WHO responseThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognizes NCDs as a major challenge for sustainable development. As part of the Agenda, heads of state and government committed to develop ambitious national responses, by 2030, to reduce by one third premature mortality from NCDs through prevention and treatment (SDG target 3.4). WHO plays a key leadership role in the coordination and promotion of the global fight against NCDs and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals target 3.4.In 2019, the World Health Assembly extended the WHO Global action plan for the prevention and control of NCDs 2013\u20132020 to 2030 and called for the development of an Implementation Roadmap 2023 to 2030 to accelerate progress on preventing and controlling NCDs. The Roadmap supports actions to achieve a set of nine global targets with the greatest impact towards prevention and management of NCDs.

    "abstract": "Heart failure remains a major global health challenge, and despite therapeutic advances, chronic disease self-management continues to show significant gaps at patient, provider, and system levels. This narrative review synthesizes evidence published between 2000 and 2025 across randomized trials, systematic reviews, guideline statements, and qualitative studies to examine the effectiveness of education, lifestyle modification, medication adherence strategies, digital health tools, and psychosocial support in improving self-management outcomes. The literature consistently demonstrates that patient education, structured exercise, and dietary modification enhance clinical and quality-of-life outcomes, while digital health interventions offer promising but variable long-term benefits. Persistent disparities rooted in socioeconomic status, cultural beliefs, health literacy, and access to technology influence the uptake and effectiveness of self-management strategies. Implementation science underscores challenges related to cost, scalability, and sustainability, whereas patient perspectives emphasize the need for simplified treatment regimens, caregiver involvement, and culturally tailored education. Overall, optimizing chronic disease self-management in heart failure requires a holistic, patient-centered approach that integrates evidence-based strategies with real-world implementation considerations and equity-focused adaptations. Future research should prioritize digital health innovations, caregiver-patient dyadic models, and culturally adapted interventions to reduce disparities and improve long-term outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Each year, over 1 million people in the United States die from diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). These largely preventable chronic conditions also create a financial burden on patients, payers, and healthcare systems. The popularity of GLP-1-based management of cardiometabolic conditions can escalate healthcare spending, while incentivizing digitization of semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy), tirzepatide (Mounjaro), and others using the \"prescription drug use-related software\" (PDURS) framework. In this article, we highlight opportunities to advance digital-first interventions and metformin-enhanced digital therapeutics (DTx) for the primary prevention of diabetes and CVDs. Metformin is a low-cost antidiabetic medication that is effective in preventing diabetes and cardiovascular adverse events. Concurrently, digital health technologies for managing chronic conditions, e.g., Dario Health, Omada Health, and WellDoc, enable digital-first and drug + digital combination therapies for prediabetes and those at risk for CVDs. We describe incentives for advancing Affordable Primary Prevention (APP), suggesting that nonprofit healthcare systems, such as Kaiser Permanente, Intermountain Health or Ascension Health, payers such as Cigna and Aetna/CVS Health, or private equity investors can leverage their venture funds to support development of metformin-enhanced DTx. In conclusion, (1) the PDURS framework can accelerate innovation of preventive medicine by bridging precision digital interventions with low-cost generic drugs, and (2) integrating healthy behaviors with pharmacotherapies is essential for the financially sustainable prevention of lifestyle-related chronic diseases.",

This model of care actively supports the development of mindful and proactive behaviors by patients in managing their own lifestyle habits. Furthermore, teleassistance is an effective tool in promoting therapeutic adherence, particularly in the post-hospital discharge phase. The literature review carried out in this study confirms these benefits. However, there is a need to explore the effectiveness of nursing teleassistance in relation to other relevant clinical outcomes, such as the reduction of new hospitalizations, post-discharge complications, mortality and healthcare-related costs.",

We describe the use of a self-management tool, a mobile health application (app) designed to support his healthy lifestyle. The app enabled monitoring of his daily activities and provided rewards for goal setting and the achievement of positive health.

    "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, incurable condition. Effective self-management behaviors can enable patients to monitor disease progression, alleviate symptoms, and enhance quality of life. However, the mechanisms underlying self-management behaviors remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the relationship between disease knowledge, coping style, social support, self-efficacy, and self-management behaviors in Chinese patients with RA, framed within the Information-Motivation-Behavioural skills model. A cross-sectional study was conducted among patients with RA from the rheumatology and immunology department of a tertiary hospital in Sichuan Province, China between September 2021 and March 2022. Data were collected by questionnaires. Structural equation modeling was employed to examine the direct and indirect pathways linking disease knowledge, coping style, social support, self-efficacy, and self-management behaviors. A total of 529 participants completed the questionnaire. The mean score of self-management behaviors was 61.68\u2005\u00b1\u200514.84. Disease knowledge (\u03b2\u2005=\u20050.351, 95% CI [0.211-0.478]), confrontation (\u03b2\u2005=\u20050.341, 95% CI [0.213-0.465]), and self-efficacy (\u03b2\u2005=\u20050.104, 95% CI [0.030-0.17]) had significant direct effects on self-management behaviors. Additionally, disease knowledge (\u03b2\u2005=\u20050.309, 95% CI [0.177-0.437]), avoidance coping (\u03b2\u2005=\u2005-0.023, 95% CI [-0.049 to -0.007]), and social support (\u03b2\u2005=\u20050.015, 95% CI [0.002-0.041]) indirectly influenced self-management behaviors through self-efficacy. Self-efficacy emerged as a key mediator in RA self-management, linking cognitive, motivational, and social factors. Interventions that enhance disease knowledge, promote proactive coping strategies, and strengthen social support: guided by the Information-Motivation-Behavioural skills model: may optimize self-management behaviors and improve clinical outcomes. These findings provide both theoretical and practical insights into psychosocial determinants of self-management in RA.",

African Americans have a risk of developing chronic kidney disease and are almost four times more likely to progress to ESKD compared to non-Hispanic whites. The presence of social adversities impacts the complex self-management of DKD and negatively impacts health outcomes. Patient navigation interventions offer a promising strategy to improve health outcomes in individuals with chronic disease. However, it is not known whether a basic needs navigation intervention that addresses social adversities in combination with patient education and lifestyle coaching leads to improved clinical and patient-centered outcomes.",

    "title": "Protecting the endocrine axis in immuno-oncology: GLP-1 receptor agonists as host-directed modulators in colorectal cancer.",
    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed colorectal cancer (CRC), particularly in microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) and mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) tumors, delivering durable responses and long-term survival. Yet this success is shadowed by immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Among them, endocrine toxicities including thyroiditis, hypophysitis, adrenalitis, and insulin-deficient diabetes are relatively frequent, irreversible, and frequently life-long. Survivors who might otherwise be considered cured remain tethered to chronic hormone replacement, underscoring a striking gap in immuno-oncology: management is reactive, supportive, and devoid of preventive strategies. Concurrently, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), introduced for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity, are emerging as systemic modulators of inflammation, immunometabolism, and the gut microbiome. These three axes converge on mechanisms central to endocrine irAEs. Preclinical and epidemiologic data suggest that GLP-1RAs may also be associated with reduced cancer incidence and alterations in tumor-associated immune responses, raising the possibility of dual utility: mitigating endocrine autoimmunity while preserving or even augmenting anti-tumor efficacy. At the same time, their appetite-suppressing and weight-reducing effects highlight the countervailing risk of exacerbating cancer cachexia, demanding careful integration with nutritional and exercise strategies. Here, we synthesize current understanding of ICI-induced endocrine injury, delineate the immunobiology of GLP-1RAs, and develop a unified mechanistic framework linking these domains in CRC. We propose a translational roadmap spanning retrospective pharmacoepidemiology, biomarker-driven stratification, and prospective clinical trials. More broadly, GLP-1RAs exemplify host-directed therapies that may help shift the therapeutic focus of immuno-oncology toward preserving survivorship and endocrine health as integral endpoints of cancer care.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic atherosclerosis results from the interplay between metabolic dysfunction and immune dysregulation and remains the major cause of mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) worldwide. Emerging evidence indicates that impaired immune checkpoint signaling, particularly through the PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 pathways, contributes to the chronic vascular inflammation characteristic of diabetic cardiovascular disease. These checkpoints normally help maintain vascular homeostasis by limiting proatherogenic immune responses. In type 2 diabetes (T2D), which accounts for 90-95% of cases, chronic hyperglycemia downregulates checkpoint expression in both immune effector cells and the vascular endothelium. In type 1 diabetes (T1D), autoimmune-mediated checkpoint failure within the pancreatic islets extends to the vascular tissues, creating an early cardiovascular risk through overlapping but distinct mechanisms. The loss of checkpoint regulation amplifies Th1 and Th17 responses while impairing regulatory T cell function and accelerating plaque formation and destabilization. Observations from cancer patients receiving checkpoint inhibitors, who exhibit increased cardiovascular events, further highlight the importance of these pathways in vascular integrity. Restoring checkpoint signaling through targeted interventions, combined with biomarker-driven stratification and personalized immune profiling, may provide new strategies for preventing or slowing atherosclerotic progression in patients with diabetes.",

    "abstract": "While lifestyle modification is recommended as first-line treatment for lowering blood pressure (BP) in individuals with prehypertension and drug-na\u00efve stage 1 hypertension, there is a paucity of randomized controlled data on such subjects. This multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial enrolled 70 participants (N\u2009=\u200935 per group) with prehypertension and drug-na\u00efve stage 1 hypertension, defined as a systolic BP (SBP) of 130-159 mmHg and/or a diastolic BP (DBP) of 85-99 mmHg. The diet & exercise (D&E) group received counseling and monitoring on diet (DASH; dietary approaches to stop hypertension) and regular physical exercise for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in systolic and diastolic BP after 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included the 24-hour BP and its components and inflammatory markers. Compared with the control group, office SBP and DBP were reduced in the D&E group by 15.1 (-8.73 vs. 6.38 mmHg, p\u2009=\u20090.003) and 6.68 (-4.57 vs. 2.11 mmHg, p\u2009=\u20090.003) mmHg, respectively. The 24-hour ambulatory SBP did not change significantly in either group after 12 weeks (-0.72 vs. 1.92 mmHg, p\u2009=\u20090.667). In subgroup analysis, female, older-age participants and participants with higher baseline BP showed higher reductions in office SBP. Positive effects on office BP were noted by dietary and exercise education, especially in female and older-age participants.Trial registration: 15/05/2022, NCT05274971.",

Chronic inflammation, immune dysregulation, and metabolic disturbances contribute to this burden. To summarize the mechanisms linking SjD to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and propose evidence-based strategies for risk assessment and management, we reviewed the current literature on immune-mediated vascular dysfunction, autoantibody profiles, dyslipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance, and lifestyle factors in SjD. It also evaluates pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions. SjD patients exhibit both traditional and disease-specific cardiovascular risk factors. Autoantibody positivity (anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB) correlates with increased risk of thrombotic events. Systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction are central to pathogenesis. Statins, ACE inhibitors, and metformin show promise in mitigating risk. Lifestyle interventions, including Mediterranean diet and aerobic exercise, offer additional benefits. Thus, cardiovascular risk management should be an integral part of SjD care. A multidisciplinary approach combining clinical evaluation, targeted therapies, and lifestyle modification is essential to reduce morbidity and improve outcomes.",

    "title": "In the Mouth or in the Gut? Innovation Through Implementing Oral and Gastrointestinal Health Science in Chronic Pain Management.",
    "abstract": "Recent scientific advances point towards an important role for oral and gastrointestinal health in people with chronic pain. Poor oral health (e.g., periodontitis, tooth loss) is observed in subgroups of the chronic pain population, including abdominal pain, low back pain, fibromyalgia, and rheumatoid arthritis. In addition to poor oral health, studies have also revealed altered intestinal microbiota compositions in various types of chronic pain, including people with chronic low back pain, knee osteoarthritis, visceral pain, fibromyalgia, tinnitus, and migraine. While overweight/obesity contributes to the likelihood of gut dysbiosis, normal-weight individuals with chronic pain also more often present with poor gut health. Both gastrointestinal and oral health problems (e.g., periodontitis, tooth loss) are increasingly recognized across multiple chronic pain conditions, including abdominal pain, low back pain, fibromyalgia, and rheumatoid arthritis. This perspective paper provides an overview of the requirements for integrating oral and gastrointestinal health in chronic pain management. First and foremost, oral and gastrointestinal health issues need to be recognized as common chronic pain comorbidities that require tailored treatment. Next to recognition of the issue, individuals seeking care for chronic pain need to be screened routinely for these oral and gastrointestinal comorbidities. In terms of management, the following options are suggested: (1) providing oral and gastrointestinal health science education; (2) considering the possible interplay between the gut microbiome and drug treatment (including polypharmacy); (3) expanding the importance of dietary interventions; and (4) considering the potential interplay with other lifestyle factors (e.g., chronic insomnia, overweight/obesity, depression and anxiety). To inform the implementation of these suggestions, longitudinal cohort studies investigating the role of oral and gastrointestinal health in people with chronic pain, as well as studies exploring possible (modifiable) factors that affect the oral and/or gut microbiome, are needed. This includes the bidirectional interplay between the gut microbiome and drugs commonly prescribed to patients with chronic pain. Likewise, adequately powered and controlled clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of possible treatments for oral and/or gastrointestinal comorbidities in people with chronic pain represent another research priority. Such randomized clinical trials can not only examine the possible causal link between poor oral/gut health and treatment outcomes, but also inform the development of new, innovative ways to improve care for people with chronic pain.",

Electromyographic (EMG) activity was assessed pre- and post-treatment using mean root mean square (RMS) amplitude values and co-contraction indices of selected lower limb muscles during preferred and fast walking. Pain intensity, knee and ankle strength, and self-reported disability were also evaluated. Significant group*time interactions were observed for the vastus medialis, semitendinosus, and tibialis anterior, with post-treatment EMG activity decreasing in the IASTM group and increasing in the sham group. All mean RMS values and co-contraction indices were significantly higher during fast walking. A significant speed*time interaction for the vastus lateralis revealed more pronounced post-treatment reductions during fast walking, with a trend toward decreased activity in the IASTM group and increased activity in the sham group. Both groups demonstrated significant improvements in pain, disability, and muscle strength; however, the IASTM group showed greater improvements, supported by significant interaction effects. Correlation analysis revealed that EMG activity in the rectus femoris, vastus medialis, and biceps femoris was moderately and positively associated with pain levels. The rectus femoris and medial gastrocnemius also showed inverse associations with muscle strength. Although both groups showed improvements in pain, strength, and disability, greater gains were observed in the IASTM group. Notably, IASTM combined with exercise therapy also reduced EMG activity. This reduction, alongside increased strength, suggests enhanced neuromuscular efficiency, which may decrease intra-articular loading associated with elevated muscle activation-commonly observed in KOA patients-while supporting joint stability. These findings highlight the potential benefit of incorporating soft tissue mobilization techniques alongside exercise therapy in KOA rehabilitation programs.\u00a0Trial registration\u00a0This trial was registered on 14 January 2022 at https://www.irct.behdasht.gov.ir with the registration code IRCT20201128049511N3.

    "abstract": "Postoperative management, including rehabilitation and physical therapy, is important to decrease pain and improve return to function in human and small animal orthopedic surgical cases; however, recommendations for postoperative management for equine orthopedic surgical cases is limited. As the field of equine rehabilitation continues to expand, we must understand how postoperative management and rehabilitation modalities are being used to determine evidence based guidelines for commonly utilized modalities. The objectives of this cross-sectional survey were to (1) investigate postoperative management recommendations for four common equine orthopedic surgical scenarios by diplomates of the American College of Veterinary Surgeons (ACVS) and American College of Veterinary Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation (ACVSMR) and to (2) determine if recommendations were different between specialties and (3) different between surgical scenarios. An electronic cross-sectional survey with four equine orthopedic surgical scenarios (simple arthroscopy [SA], septic arthritis [SJ], deep digital flexor tendon tear [DT], and neurectomy of the deep branch of the lateral plantar nerve and fasciotomy [NF]) with questions regarding postoperative management recommendations was distributed to diplomates of the ACVS and ACVSMR. A total of 85 surveys were completed. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory administration, bandaging, hand-walking, and small paddock turnout, were most recommended for all scenarios. SA, SJ, and NF cases had small paddock turnout, full turnout, and ridden exercise recommended sooner than DT cases. Longer periods of hand-walking and small paddock turnout were recommended for DT cases. Intrathecal therapies were most frequently recommended for DT cases. ACVSMR diplomates were more likely to recommend rehabilitation modalities for certain scenarios. In conclusion, results of this survey describe postoperative management for equine orthopedic surgical cases recommended by ACVS and ACVSMR diplomates. Few differences were identified in recommendations between diplomates. Differences were identified between the different surgical case scenarios.",

Northern regions show higher rates than southern regions, reflecting variation in access to primary care, respiratory specialists, and pulmonary rehabilitation. These patterns indicate that supply sensitive factors contribute significantly to unequal outcomes. Reducing avoidable hospitalisations will require fairer resource allocation, earlier community based management, and stronger coordination between hospital and primary care services.",
