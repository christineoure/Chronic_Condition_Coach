  "abstract": "Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a rare but potentially curable form of pulmonary hypertension. Pathology is characterized by persistent, organized thrombi causing mechanical vascular obstruction, often accompanied by a small-vessel vasculopathy. In 2023, balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) was introduced in our institution as a new treatment option for managing CTEPH.",
