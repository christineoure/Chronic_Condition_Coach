  "summary": "The vast majority of glaucoma cases in the United States go undetected and untreated until the late stages of the disease. Open-angle glaucoma is a progressive condition that is asymptomatic in its early to moderate stages and may be amenable to screening through telemedicine-based approaches. This study is a randomized trial to evaluate whether glaucoma screening with established tests (e.g., optical coherence tomography, fundus photography, and tonometry) is more effective for detecting undiagnosed glaucoma cases compared to education alone or delayed intervention.",
