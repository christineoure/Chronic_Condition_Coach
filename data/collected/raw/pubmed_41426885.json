  "title": "Readmissions in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: A Five-Year Retrospective Study in a Romanian Emergency County Hospital.",
  "abstract": "Hospital readmissions represent a significant problem in the management of chronic\u00a0diseases, provoking a substantial burden both on patients and the national healthcare system. Chronic diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, heart\u00a0failure, and liver cirrhosis have documented risk factors, and guidelines are being continuously developed for reducing readmissions. Despite advancements, readmission patterns in some chronic conditions still remain underexplored. Recurrent hospitalizations among inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients may reflect disease severity, frequency of complications, and inadequate outpatient management, which can negatively impact quality of life and increase financial strain on healthcare systems. This study aimed to characterize readmission frequency, timing, and causes in Crohn's disease (CD) vs ulcerative colitis (UC) patients over a five-year period, and to identify factors associated with readmissions.",
