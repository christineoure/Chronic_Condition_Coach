  "title": "Self-Management Combined With Digital Health Interventions to Improve Dietary Behavior, Exercise Behavior, Stress Management Behavior, and Blood Pressure Among Thais With Uncontrolled Hypertension: Protocol for an Explanatory Sequential Study.",
  "abstract": "Uncontrolled hypertension causes substantial morbidity and mortality as well as rising health care costs. Adherence to self-management is critical for minimizing the risk of hypertensive complications. Traditional self-management is hindered by delayed management and insufficient support. Digital health interventions offer a feasible solution for closing these gaps and enhancing hypertension self-management. Little is known about patients' perspectives and experiences concerning how digital health interventions influence their self-management.",
