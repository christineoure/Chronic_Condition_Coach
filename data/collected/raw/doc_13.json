  "title": "Integrative multimodal treatment approach for patients suffering from Post-COVID syndrome: a study based on qualitative interviews with individuals participating in an 11-week\u202fday clinic program.",
  "abstract": "Post-COVID syndrome is a complex condition affecting patients after SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is characterized by fatigue, pain, reduced resilience, and quality of life. Severe cases resemble myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), associated with post-exertional malaise (PEM). Due to the unknown etiology and lack of curative options, multimodal therapy offers a particularly promising approach to symptom management.",
