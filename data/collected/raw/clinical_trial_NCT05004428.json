  "summary": "In this observational study, data from the recent past of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease will be studied.\n\nType 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a condition in which the body does not make enough of a hormone called insulin or does not use insulin well. This results in high blood sugar levels. About half of people with T2DM also have a condition called chronic kidney disease (CKD). In people with CKD, the kidneys' ability to work as how it should decreases over time.\n\nIn this study, researchers want to learn more about the CKD in T2DM patients in Alberta, Canada. This will help them to know the chances to improve the care of these patients.\n\nThe researchers will look at the health information from adult men and women in Alberta who were diagnosed with T2DM before 2018 and visited a doctor to have check-ups in 2018. They will find out about how many of these people had CKD and how severe their CKD was. The researchers will collect data about the age and gender of these patients, how long they had T2DM and if they had other related medical problems. The researchers will also learn how these patients were treated based on their kidney condition and how much money was spent on these treatments.\n\nThis study will collect information from the health records of about 270,000 patients with T2DM who were living in Alberta, Canada. This information will come from the Alberta Kidney Disease Network (AKDN) database. Besides this data collection, no further tests or examinations are planned in this study.",
