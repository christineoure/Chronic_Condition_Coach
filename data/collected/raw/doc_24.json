  "abstract": "Elevated childhood blood pressure (BP) levels may persist into adulthood, and persistent exposure to elevated BP since childhood may increase the adulthood risk of hypertension. This study examined the tracking of childhood BP into adulthood over 38\u2009years. We also studied the association between long-term cumulative BP exposure in childhood and adolescence and the risk of developing hypertension in adulthood.",
