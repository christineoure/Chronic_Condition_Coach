  "title": "The lncRNA PARylator promotes PARP1 activation and resistance to DNA\u2011damaging therapy in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.",
  "abstract": "Outcomes for patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remain poor, partly due to treatment resistance, particularly to DNA-damaging therapies. Poly(ADP\u2011ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) plays a critical role in repairing single\u2011strand DNA breaks (SSBs). Unrepaired SSBs can be converted into double\u2011strand breaks (DSBs) during DNA replication, potentially leading to cell death. Genomic amplification of the distal portion of chromosome 3q (3q26-q29) is a frequent copy\u2011number alteration in ESCC, which harbors genes encoding several oncoproteins. However, whether long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) from this region contribute to ESCC pathogenesis and treatment resistance remains poorly understood.",
