  "title": "The Influence of Hyaluronic Acid Injection Following Knee Arthroscopy",
  "conditions": [
    "Cartilage Damage"
  ],
  "interventions": [
    "Sodium Hyaluronate 1%",
    "Placebo"
  ],
  "phase": "PHASE4",
  "summary": "This is a prospective, double blind randomized controlled trial. In this study we will investigate the influence of hyaluronic acid injection to knee after knee arthroscopy, when known or discovered cartilage damage greater than International Cartilage Research Society score (ICRS) grade 2 is found. The indication for arthroscopy is not necessarily the cartilage damage. A set of 3 consecutive injections will be administered and follow up of physical examination and questionaries will be done.\n\nOur null hypothesis is that the administration of hyaluronic acid will show decrease pain and quicker rehabilitation and return to normal activity in patients with grade 2 and higher cartilage damage that had gone through knee arthroscopy.",
