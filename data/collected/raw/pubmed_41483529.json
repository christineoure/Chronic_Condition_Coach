  "abstract": "Klebsiella pneumoniae pyogenic liver abscess (KP-PLA) is increasingly recognized as a cause of endogenous endophthalmitis (EE), particularly in East and Southeast Asia. Hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKP) strains have been implicated in severe ocular complications, yet comprehensive data on incidence, risk factors, and visual outcomes are limited.",
