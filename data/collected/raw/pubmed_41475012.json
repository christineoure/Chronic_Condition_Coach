  "title": "Renal Resistive Index and Cardiovascular Events, Cardiovascular Mortality, and All-Cause Mortality: Protocol for a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
  "abstract": "The renal resistive index (RRI) is a noninvasive indicator of renal vascular resistance and systemic hemodynamic status. Elevated RRI values have been consistently associated with subclinical vascular damage and target organ injury. Observational studies within the past decade have suggested that RRI may also serve as a prognostic marker for adverse cardiovascular outcomes and mortality. However, the evidence remains scattered and heterogeneous, and no systematic review has yet synthesized this body of literature.",
