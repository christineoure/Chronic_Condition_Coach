Poly(ADP ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) plays a critical role in repairing single strand DNA breaks (SSBs). Unrepaired SSBs can be converted into double strand breaks (DSBs) during DNA replication, potentially leading to cell death. Genomic amplification of the distal portion of chromosome 3q (3q26-q29) is a frequent copy number alteration in ESCC, which harbors genes encoding several oncoproteins. However, whether long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) from this region contribute to ESCC pathogenesis and treatment resistance remains poorly understood.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a condition in which the body does not make enough of a hormone called insulin or does not use insulin well. This results in high blood sugar levels. About half of people with T2DM also have a condition called chronic kidney disease (CKD). In people with CKD, the kidneys' ability to work as how it should decreases over time. In this study, researchers want to learn more about the CKD in T2DM patients in Alberta, Canada. This will help them to know the chances to improve the care of these patients. The researchers will look at the health information from adult men and women in Alberta who were diagnosed with T2DM before 2018 and visited a doctor to have check-ups in 2018. They will find out about how many of these people had CKD and how severe their CKD was. The researchers will collect data about the age and gender of these patients, how long they had T2DM and if they had other related medical problems. The researchers will also learn how these patients were treated based on their kidney condition and how much money was spent on these treatments. This study will collect information from the health records of about 270,000 patients with T2DM who were living in Alberta, Canada. This information will come from the Alberta Kidney Disease Network (AKDN) database.

However, sugar control is difficult to achieve and suboptimal use of insulin is thought to be a contributory factor. Though it is known that generally the consumption of carbohydrates alone raises the blood sugar, the usual practice of dosing meal-time insulin is based on the fraction of the total meal-tray eaten which includes proteins, fats and carbohydrates. This leads to an overestimation of insulin required for a patient who consumes a portion of mainly proteins and fats on their trays or an underestimation for those eating mainly the carbohydrates on their tray.

Globally the prevalence of HTN is over 25  for adults, and accounts for approximately 13.5  of all deaths. Given the aging of the population together with increases in obesity and sedentary behavior, it is not surprising that HTN is projected to increase significantly over the next several decades; with over 1.5 billion adults having HTN by the year 2025. Thus the public health implications to preventing and or reducing elevations in blood pressure are substantial. This study compares the efficacy of two different non-pharmacologic interventions (device guided breathing and isometric hand grip exercises) used alone and in combination for lowering blood pressure. This pilot study will include 30 adults with stage 1 hypertension. The primary outcome is the change in blood pressure from baseline to 8 weeks. Secondary outcomes include change in blood pressure from 8 weeks to 16 weeks and acceptability of the interventions by participants.

The Telemedicine Enhanced Asthma Management-Uniting Providers (TEAM-UP) program enhances a school-based, primary care directed asthma program with specialist-supported care to ensure optimal guideline based treatment. This study is a full-scale randomized trial of TEAM-UP versus an enhanced care comparison group. Primary care physicians (PCP) of all enrolled children (n 360, 4-12 yrs.) will be prompted to initiate directly observed therapy (DOT) of preventive asthma medication through school and to make a specialist referral. For children in the TEAM-UP group, the specialist visits will be facilitated via telemedicine at school. The telemedicine specialist visit will be scheduled after approximately 4 weeks of initiating DOT, in order to allow for accurate guideline-based assessments of medication and care needs once adherence with a daily controller medication is established. There will also be up to 2 telemedicine follow-up specialist visits to assess the child's response to treatment and make needed adjustments. The study will use the existing community infrastructure by implementing both telemedicine and DOT in school, and maintaining collaboration with PCPs. Blinded follow-ups will occur at 3-, 5-, 7- and 12-months after baseline, and the primary outcome is the comparison of symptom-free days (SFD) at each follow-up time point.",clinicaltrials.gov,Asthma in Children,40,0,1,222,trial_NCT03545906,Telemedicine Enhanced Asthma Management - Uniting Providers,,

pubmed_41484425_0,"Genotype-guided warfarin dosing has shown improved anticoagulation outcomes in individuals of European and Asian ancestry. However, its usefulness in specific subgroups remains uncertain. This open-label, non-inferiority randomized trial (NCT00700895) was conducted across three academic hospitals in Southeast Asia to assess the utility of genotype-guided warfarin dosing in Asian patients, focusing on specific potentially high-risk subgroups. We enrolled 322 newly initiated warfarin patients. The primary endpoint was the number of dose adjustments within the first 14 days of treatment, with a non-inferiority margin of 0.5. Clinical follow-up lasted 90 days. Among 322 randomized patients, 269 (mean age 58.7 years, 59.9  males) were evaluated for the primary endpoint. The pharmacogenetic algorithm significantly reduced dose titrations during the initial 14 days compared to the traditional dosing algorithm, without compromising safety. This benefit was consistent in those with atrial fibrillation (N   101, mean difference -1.63, 95  CI -2.16 to -1.10), non-atrial fibrillation indications (N   165, mean difference -0.88, 95  CI -1.26 to -0.49), stroke-only indications (N   19, mean difference -1.60, 95  CI -2.83 to -0.37), history of acute myocardial infarction (N   20), congestive heart failure (N   34), hypertension (N   152), diabetes mellitus (N   95), and across races (Chinese, N   163; Malay, Indian and Others, N   104), sexes (female, N   161 and male, N   108), and age groups (  65 years, N   168 and   65 years, N   101). However, no significant reduction was observed in patients with a history of stroke. There were no differences in minor or major bleeding complications, recurrent venous thromboembolism, or out-of-range INR measurements across most subgroups.

pubmed_41474893_0,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) poses an important worldwide health challenge, impacting over 400 million individuals globally. It ranks as the seventh most common reason for mortality. Among its forms, T2DM is the most widespread, accounting for close to 90.0  of all identified cases. Recognized as a critical chronic health issue, Type 2 diabetes contributes to early morbidity, heart-related conditions and various other health complications. Over the last two decades, advancements in medical science have introduced novel medications to manage high levels of blood sugar in T2DM. Alongside these developments, updated clinical guidelines now emphasize strict glucose management in the initial phases of the condition. This has complicated the selection of appropriate medications, leading to significant shifts in prescription trends, with notable differences observed across nations based on available treatment options. The study aimed to judge the various categories of oral diabetes medications used at the start of therapy, the prevalence of single-drug versus multi-drug approaches and the average count of medications suggested per patient visit. This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Department of Pharmacology in collaboration with the Department of Endocrinology Outpatients' Department in Mymensingh Medical College Hospital (MMCH), Mymensingh, Bangladesh. The mostfrequently used single drug is metformin (38.92 ) and the most generally used combination therapy is Sulfonylurea   Biguanides   DPP4 inhibitor (44.77 ). It is concluded that in T2DM cases, metformin was the most usually used drug both in initial drug treatment and as a single drug treatment.

pubmed_41462479_0,"Diabetes mellitus includes a wide range of chronic metabolic disorders that result in severe hyperglycemia and other damages in diabetic patients due to impaired insulin secretion or insulin inefficiency. This study purpose was to consider of the potential therapeutic properties of MSCs-derived EVs Exo against DM. A complete systematic search was achieved in various electronic databases (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed and Embase) up to June 2025, following the PRISMA guidelines. A whole of 89 studies were screened based on predetermined standards for inclusion and exclusion. Eventually, the current systematic study contained 13 publications that had the criteria of inclusion. According to the findings of this study, MSCs-derived EVs Exo reduce DM and hyperglycemia with the high ability to regulate inflammatory-immune responses and activate autophagy pathways. However, compared to the diabetic groups, treatment with MSCs-derived EVs Exo revealed tendency towards immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, regeneration and neogenesis of β-islets. In other studies, have been identified that DM causes significant biochemical changes in beta cells pancreas tissue. In addition, obvious histological changes were observed in pancreatic tissue following DM. Generally, MSCs-derived EVs Exo administration modulated most of the histological and biochemical changes caused by diabetes. Notably, the DM is improved through recovering damaged tissues, increasing insulin levels and glycemic stability. It seems that, MSCs-derived EVs Exo exert these protective and therapeutic properties through the modulating of multiple mechanisms that are implicated in DM.

pubmed_41487794_0,"Anticoagulation is typically withheld in cases of severe thrombocytopenia, but clinical decision-making becomes challenging when a patient has multiple established venous and arterial thrombogenic risk factors, along with a fluctuating platelet level. Given the absence of clear guidelines and with an uncertain balance of risks and benefits, this case report and the accompanying discussion may offer useful insights for managing similar situations in the future. A 70 year old male with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung presented to the emergency department for evaluation of worsening fatigue and weakness, which had led to a presyncopal episode with a ground-level fall. His cancer had been diagnosed one year prior and treated monthly with radiation, chemo, and immunotherapies. On admission, he was hypotensive, tachycardic, febrile, and markedly pancytopenic. CT imaging suggested pneumonia superimposed on an extensive tumor burden. He was also found to have new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) with a rapid ventricular rate. This was initially rate-controlled with labetalol, but anticoagulation was held due to thrombocytopenia, despite a CHADS₂ VASc score of 2. He was transferred to the ICU for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and septic shock complicated by pancytopenia and neutropenic fever. The patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, steroids, filgrastim, vasopressors, intubation, and multiple transfusions (three units of platelets and one unit of packed red blood cells) during the first three days of his five-day admission. Platelet counts ranged between 11 and 61 10³ µL despite interventions. On day three, blood cultures grew Pseudomonas; antibiotics were narrowed, and he was successfully extubated to bilevel positive airway pressure. By day four, his atrial fibrillation converted to sinus rhythm for the first time during this admission, and digoxin was initiated due to ongoing hypotension. Subsequently, he developed a complicated pleural effusion that required chest tube placement. Unfortunately, on day five of admission, he exhibited ST segment elevations (V2-V6) consistent with anterior myocardial infarction. Due to thrombocytopenia, comorbidities, and goals of care, anticoagulation and reperfusion interventions were deferred. Care transitioned to comfort measures only, and he died 48 hours later. This report highlights a unique instance of a common clinical dilemma: determining whether to initiate or withhold anticoagulation in a thrombocytopenic patient with multiple high-risk prothrombotic factors.

This study investigated the modulatory effects of C. lanatus juice on pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1) gene expression and glycemic control in fortified-diet-fed streptozotocin-induced diabetic Wistar rats. Thirty-six rats weighing 90-110 g, were randomized into six groups: normal control (NMC), diabetic control (DBC), metformin-treated diabetic rats (DBM, 500 mg kg), and diabetic rats treated with C. lanatus juice at 200 mg kg (DBCL1), 500 mg kg (DBCL2), and 1000 mg kg (DBCL3). Animals were pre-fed either normal or fortified diets prior to diabetes induction with streptozotocin (35 mg kg). Following 14 days of treatment, blood and pancreatic tissues were analyzed for glycemic, antioxidant, and molecular parameters. C. lanatus juice significantly (p   0.05) reduced fasting blood glucose in a dose-dependent manner, with the greatest effect observed in DBCL3.

pubmed_41343041_0,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous chronic lung condition often accompanied by comorbidities and systemic manifestations that affect the person's clinical condition and prognosis and often require specific treatment. Therefore, the management of COPD extends beyond treatment for the lungs per se. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) should be considered as part of person-centered management, and supervised exercise training is a core component of this intervention. PR exercise training parameters (e.g., frequency, intensity, time, and type) should be individualized to maximize each individual's functional gains while targeting systemic manifestations and comorbidities. This manuscript presents evidence-based tailored recommendations for optimizing exercise interventions for people with COPD and comorbidities that significantly affect prognosis (e.g., mortality, hospitalizations) including cardiovascular disease (CVD) (e.g., chronic coronary syndrome, heart failure), CVD risk factors (e.g., type 2 diabetes mellitus [T2DM], hypertension), and sarcopenia. To achieve these goals, existing guidelines and evidence for exercise training in COPD, CVD, CVD risk factors, and sarcopenia have been reviewed to identify synergies between PR and cardiac rehabilitation, as well as the treatment of T2DM and sarcopenia. In addition, we provided clinical cases to illustrate how PR can be adapted to accommodate specific comorbidities. These examples offer practical guidance for tailoring exercise prescriptions within PR programs to address the unique needs of people with COPD and clinically relevant comorbidities, thereby enhancing overall treatment effectiveness and optimizing health outcomes.

pubmed_41497943_0,"Background and objective Cardiovascular disease (CVD) represents a principal contributor to premature morbidity and mortality in individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Effective lipid management, including the use of statin therapy, offers substantial potential to mitigate long term vascular risk, particularly among patients with established microvascular complications or long disease duration. This study aimed to assess the extent to which statin prescribing practices in a large healthcare trust align with the current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines. Methods We performed a retrospective review of electronic health records for T1DM patients under the care of a single healthcare trust. Patients were stratified into two groups based on age:  40 years and  40 years. According to NICE criteria, statin therapy is indicated for patients aged  40 years, or those of any age with diabetes duration  10 years, diabetic nephropathy, or other modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. The main outcome measure was the proportion of eligible patients who had been prescribed statin therapy. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results Among 1,229 patients aged  40 years, 896 (73 ) were receiving statins, leaving 333 (27 ) without therapy despite being eligible. In the  40 years age group, 192 patients met NICE indications for statin use. Prescription rates were notably lower in this cohort: six (35 ) for those with nephropathy, 2two(15 ) among those with retinopathy, and 75 (47 ) for patients with both risk factors. Overall, only 83 (43 ) of eligible patients under 40 were prescribed statins. Conclusions Our findings reveal a significant gap between guideline recommendations and real-world prescribing patterns, particularly among younger T1DM patients with additional CVD risk factors. Given the elevated cardiovascular risk in this population, strategies to enhance clinician awareness and improve adherence to NICE guidance are urgently needed to optimize primary prevention.

pubmed_41496621_0,"Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) has emerged as a major health challenge, further intensified by the rising global prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It plays a key role in the morbidity and mortality linked to diabetes, mainly through myocardial dysfunction that develops independently of coronary artery disease or hypertensive heart disease and is a major contributor to heart failure. Despite the significance of DCM, there is no gold standard diagnostic test; rather, a multimodal approach is required that includes clinical evaluation (risk factors, and symptoms and signs), cardiac imaging techniques, and biomarkers. The integrationof all evaluations may ultimately allow for earlier identification and improved outcomes through timely intervention. In addition, there is scarce evidence on treatment of DCM. The conventional treatment approach is primarily focused on achieving glycemic control, managing cardiac dysfunction, and reducing cardiovascular events using therapies extrapolated from diabetes and heart failure guidelines, rather than targeting the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. On the other hand, beyond pharmacological approaches, lifestyle modifications, particularly exercise and dietary interventions, could play an important role in the management of DCM due to the associated cardiometabolic benefits in patients with diabetes. In this review, due to the urgent need of clarification for the specific management of DCM and the lack of consistent evidence, we provide a practical updated overview from the pathophysiology to current and future treatment strategies. By integrating this knowledge, we aim to summarize the diagnosis and therapeutic approach that could effectively mitigate or prevent the progression of DCM.

pubmed_41476907_0,"The global prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) and heart failure (HF) is rapidly increasing. Hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress in people with DM are the key etiological factors of HF. The factors disrupt systemic, myocardial and cellular mechanisms, leading to lipotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, altered calcium signaling and inflammation, ultimately resulting in HF. Heart failure on the other hand induces new-onset diabetes by modulating insulin signaling. Despite the availability of novel treatment approaches, these comorbid conditions continue to increase hospitalization, treatment expenditure and mortality. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the complex bidirectional relationship between DM and HF might be helpful in managing the associated complications of both conditions. This review aims to provide an overview of cellular and pathophysiological interplay of the glucovascular continuum from DM to HF, and vice versa. Additionally, updated estimates on prevalence and outcomes of incident HF in people with DM and new-onset DM after HF are discussed. Guidelines from the United States, Europe and Korea recommended sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) for primary prevention of DM and HF, and for reduction of HF hospitalization.

It ranks as the seventh most common reason for mortality. Among its forms, T2DM is the most widespread, accounting for close to 90.0  of all identified cases. Recognized as a critical chronic health issue, Type 2 diabetes contributes to early morbidity, heart-related conditions and various other health complications. Over the last two decades, advancements in medical science have introduced novel medications to manage high levels of blood sugar in T2DM. Alongside these developments, updated clinical guidelines now emphasize strict glucose management in the initial phases of the condition. This has complicated the selection of appropriate medications, leading to significant shifts in prescription trends, with notable differences observed across nations based on available treatment options. The study aimed to judge the various categories of oral diabetes medications used at the start of therapy, the prevalence of single-drug versus multi-drug approaches and the average count of medications suggested per patient visit.

This study purpose was to consider of the potential therapeutic properties of MSCs-derived EVs Exo against DM. A complete systematic search was achieved in various electronic databases (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed and Embase) up to June 2025, following the PRISMA guidelines. A whole of 89 studies were screened based on predetermined standards for inclusion and exclusion. Eventually, the current systematic study contained 13 publications that had the criteria of inclusion. According to the findings of this study, MSCs-derived EVs Exo reduce DM and hyperglycemia with the high ability to regulate inflammatory-immune responses and activate autophagy pathways. However, compared to the diabetic groups, treatment with MSCs-derived EVs Exo revealed tendency towards immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, regeneration and neogenesis of β-islets.

pubmed_41496621_0,"Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) has emerged as a major health challenge, further intensified by the rising global prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It plays a key role in the morbidity and mortality linked to diabetes, mainly through myocardial dysfunction that develops independently of coronary artery disease or hypertensive heart disease and is a major contributor to heart failure. Despite the significance of DCM, there is no gold standard diagnostic test; rather, a multimodal approach is required that includes clinical evaluation (risk factors, and symptoms and signs), cardiac imaging techniques, and biomarkers. The integrationof all evaluations may ultimately allow for earlier identification and improved outcomes through timely intervention. In addition, there is scarce evidence on treatment of DCM. The conventional treatment approach is primarily focused on achieving glycemic control, managing cardiac dysfunction, and reducing cardiovascular events using therapies extrapolated from diabetes and heart failure guidelines, rather than targeting the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. On the other hand, beyond pharmacological approaches, lifestyle modifications, particularly exercise and dietary interventions, could play an important role in the management of DCM due to the associated cardiometabolic benefits in patients with diabetes. In this review, due to the urgent need of clarification for the specific management of DCM and the lack of consistent evidence, we provide a practical updated overview from the pathophysiology to current and future treatment strategies. By integrating this knowledge, we aim to summarize the diagnosis and therapeutic approach that could effectively mitigate or prevent the progression of DCM.

Given the absence of clear guidelines and with an uncertain balance of risks and benefits, this case report and the accompanying discussion may offer useful insights for managing similar situations in the future. A 70 year old male with metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung presented to the emergency department for evaluation of worsening fatigue and weakness, which had led to a presyncopal episode with a ground-level fall. His cancer had been diagnosed one year prior and treated monthly with radiation, chemo, and immunotherapies. On admission, he was hypotensive, tachycardic, febrile, and markedly pancytopenic. CT imaging suggested pneumonia superimposed on an extensive tumor burden. He was also found to have new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) with a rapid ventricular rate. This was initially rate-controlled with labetalol, but anticoagulation was held due to thrombocytopenia, despite a CHADS₂ VASc score of 2. He was transferred to the ICU for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and septic shock complicated by pancytopenia and neutropenic fever. The patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, steroids, filgrastim, vasopressors, intubation, and multiple transfusions (three units of platelets and one unit of packed red blood cells) during the first three days of his five-day admission. Platelet counts ranged between 11 and 61 10³ µL despite interventions. On day three, blood cultures grew Pseudomonas; antibiotics were narrowed, and he was successfully extubated to bilevel positive airway pressure. By day four, his atrial fibrillation converted to sinus rhythm for the first time during this admission, and digoxin was initiated due to ongoing hypotension. Subsequently, he developed a complicated pleural effusion that required chest tube placement. Unfortunately, on day five of admission, he exhibited ST segment elevations (V2-V6) consistent with anterior myocardial infarction. Due to thrombocytopenia, comorbidities, and goals of care, anticoagulation and reperfusion interventions were deferred. Care transitioned to comfort measures only, and he died 48 hours later.

Effective management requires adherence to standardized international guidelines to optimize outcomes. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the management of COPD patients in accordance with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) recommendations, with particular emphasis on the appropriateness of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions relative to disease severity and risk classification. Methods This retrospective study included 350 COPD patients, confirmed by spirometry, conducted at Jinnah Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan, from January 2022 to January 2025. Data were collected from hospital records, including demographics, smoking status, comorbidities, spirometry results, GOLD classification, treatment regimens, exacerbation frequency, and non-pharmacological interventions. Patients were categorized into GOLD ABE groups based on symptom burden and exacerbation history. Results The mean age of patients was 61.4   9.8 years, with a male predominance of 218 (62.3 ). Smoking history was present in 272 (77.7 ) patients, while 64 (18.3 ) reported biomass exposure. Most patients had advanced disease, with 256 (73.1 ) in GOLD 3-4 stages and 173 (49.4 ) classified as GOLD Group E. The mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( ) predicted was 48.7   13.4. Exacerbation burden was high, with 108 (30.9 ) patients reporting  2 exacerbations annually and 98 (28.0 ) requiring hospitalization. Pharmacological management showed that 142 (40.6 ) patients received dual therapy (long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)   long-acting beta 2-agonist (LABA)) and 128 (36.6 ) received triple therapy (inhaled corticosteroid or ICS   LABA   LAMA).

pubmed_41343041_0,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a heterogeneous chronic lung condition often accompanied by comorbidities and systemic manifestations that affect the person's clinical condition and prognosis and often require specific treatment. Therefore, the management of COPD extends beyond treatment for the lungs per se. Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) should be considered as part of person-centered management, and supervised exercise training is a core component of this intervention. PR exercise training parameters (e.g., frequency, intensity, time, and type) should be individualized to maximize each individual's functional gains while targeting systemic manifestations and comorbidities. This manuscript presents evidence-based tailored recommendations for optimizing exercise interventions for people with COPD and comorbidities that significantly affect prognosis (e.g., mortality, hospitalizations) including cardiovascular disease (CVD) (e.g., chronic coronary syndrome, heart failure), CVD risk factors (e.g., type 2 diabetes mellitus [T2DM], hypertension), and sarcopenia. To achieve these goals, existing guidelines and evidence for exercise training in COPD, CVD, CVD risk factors, and sarcopenia have been reviewed to identify synergies between PR and cardiac rehabilitation, as well as the treatment of T2DM and sarcopenia. In addition, we provided clinical cases to illustrate how PR can be adapted to accommodate specific comorbidities. These examples offer practical guidance for tailoring exercise prescriptions within PR programs to address the unique needs of people with COPD and clinically relevant comorbidities, thereby enhancing overall treatment effectiveness and optimizing health outcomes.

pubmed_41497943_0,"Background and objective Cardiovascular disease (CVD) represents a principal contributor to premature morbidity and mortality in individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Effective lipid management, including the use of statin therapy, offers substantial potential to mitigate long term vascular risk, particularly among patients with established microvascular complications or long disease duration. This study aimed to assess the extent to which statin prescribing practices in a large healthcare trust align with the current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines. Methods We performed a retrospective review of electronic health records for T1DM patients under the care of a single healthcare trust. Patients were stratified into two groups based on age:  40 years and  40 years. According to NICE criteria, statin therapy is indicated for patients aged  40 years, or those of any age with diabetes duration  10 years, diabetic nephropathy, or other modifiable cardiovascular risk factors. The main outcome measure was the proportion of eligible patients who had been prescribed statin therapy. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results Among 1,229 patients aged  40 years, 896 (73 ) were receiving statins, leaving 333 (27 ) without therapy despite being eligible. In the  40 years age group, 192 patients met NICE indications for statin use. Prescription rates were notably lower in this cohort: six (35 ) for those with nephropathy, 2two(15 ) among those with retinopathy, and 75 (47 ) for patients with both risk factors. Overall, only 83 (43 ) of eligible patients under 40 were prescribed statins. Conclusions Our findings reveal a significant gap between guideline recommendations and real-world prescribing patterns, particularly among younger T1DM patients with additional CVD risk factors. Given the elevated cardiovascular risk in this population, strategies to enhance clinician awareness and improve adherence to NICE guidance are urgently needed to optimize primary prevention.

pubmed_41476907_0,"The global prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) and heart failure (HF) is rapidly increasing. Hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress in people with DM are the key etiological factors of HF. The factors disrupt systemic, myocardial and cellular mechanisms, leading to lipotoxicity, mitochondrial dysfunction, altered calcium signaling and inflammation, ultimately resulting in HF. Heart failure on the other hand induces new-onset diabetes by modulating insulin signaling. Despite the availability of novel treatment approaches, these comorbid conditions continue to increase hospitalization, treatment expenditure and mortality. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the complex bidirectional relationship between DM and HF might be helpful in managing the associated complications of both conditions. This review aims to provide an overview of cellular and pathophysiological interplay of the glucovascular continuum from DM to HF, and vice versa. Additionally, updated estimates on prevalence and outcomes of incident HF in people with DM and new-onset DM after HF are discussed. Guidelines from the United States, Europe and Korea recommended sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) for primary prevention of DM and HF, and for reduction of HF hospitalization.

Objective This study aimed to evaluate the management of COPD patients in accordance with Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) recommendations, with particular emphasis on the appropriateness of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions relative to disease severity and risk classification. Methods This retrospective study included 350 COPD patients, confirmed by spirometry, conducted at Jinnah Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan, from January 2022 to January 2025. Data were collected from hospital records, including demographics, smoking status, comorbidities, spirometry results, GOLD classification, treatment regimens, exacerbation frequency, and non-pharmacological interventions. Patients were categorized into GOLD ABE groups based on symptom burden and exacerbation history. Results The mean age of patients was 61.4   9.8 years, with a male predominance of 218 (62.3 ). Smoking history was present in 272 (77.7 ) patients, while 64 (18.3 ) reported biomass exposure. Most patients had advanced disease, with 256 (73.1 ) in GOLD 3-4 stages and 173 (49.4 ) classified as GOLD Group E. The mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( ) predicted was 48.7   13.4. Exacerbation burden was high, with 108 (30.9 ) patients reporting  2 exacerbations annually and 98 (28.0 ) requiring hospitalization. Pharmacological management showed that 142 (40.6 ) patients received dual therapy (long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)   long-acting beta 2-agonist (LABA)) and 128 (36.6 ) received triple therapy (inhaled corticosteroid or ICS   LABA   LAMA). Non-pharmacological measures were variably implemented: smoking cessation counseling was documented in 320 (91.4 ) patients, though only 114 (35.6 ) achieved abstinence; influenza and pneumococcal vaccination coverage was 122 (34.9 ) and 88 (25.1 ) patients, respectively; and pulmonary rehabilitation was accessed by 96 (27.4 ). Conclusion It is concluded that while pharmacological treatment in COPD patients largely followed GOLD guidelines, significant deficiencies were observed in the adoption of non-pharmacological interventions, vaccination, and early disease detection.

pubmed_41485762_0,"Growing evidence on the long-term efficacy and safety of sympathetic renal denervation (RDN) has established this neuromodulatory interventional therapy as the third therapeutic pillar for hypertension management, alongside lifestyle modification and pharmacotherapy. Accordingly, recent European and American guidelines have upgraded the role of RDN, recommending its consideration as an additional treatment option for selected patients with resistant or uncontrolled hypertension - particularly for those at high cardiovascular risk - when performed in experienced centers with appropriate training and within a shared decision-making framework that respects patients' preferences. This consensus document, jointly developed by the Hellenic Society of Hypertension (Hellenic Excellence Centers of Hypertension), the Hellenic Society of Cardiology (Working Groups 'Hypertension and Heart' and 'Interventional Cardiology'), the Hellenic Society of Nephrology, and the Hellenic Academy of General Practice Family Medicine and Primary Health Care, aims to provide a structured referral pathway for the clinical use of RDN in Greece. The proposed pathway integrates all contemporary therapeutic options in alignment with current hypertension guidelines and takes into account the structure of the Greek healthcare system. Ongoing and future research regarding antihypertensive therapies, including novel device-based and pharmacological interventions, is anticipated to further refine patient selection, procedural techniques, and long-term strategies to optimize cardiometabolic outcomes.

pubmed_41496621_0,"Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) has emerged as a major health challenge, further intensified by the rising global prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. It plays a key role in the morbidity and mortality linked to diabetes, mainly through myocardial dysfunction that develops independently of coronary artery disease or hypertensive heart disease and is a major contributor to heart failure. Despite the significance of DCM, there is no gold standard diagnostic test; rather, a multimodal approach is required that includes clinical evaluation (risk factors, and symptoms and signs), cardiac imaging techniques, and biomarkers. The integrationof all evaluations may ultimately allow for earlier identification and improved outcomes through timely intervention. In addition, there is scarce evidence on treatment of DCM. The conventional treatment approach is primarily focused on achieving glycemic control, managing cardiac dysfunction, and reducing cardiovascular events using therapies extrapolated from diabetes and heart failure guidelines, rather than targeting the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. On the other hand, beyond pharmacological approaches, lifestyle modifications, particularly exercise and dietary interventions, could play an important role in the management of DCM due to the associated cardiometabolic benefits in patients with diabetes. In this review, due to the urgent need of clarification for the specific management of DCM and the lack of consistent evidence, we provide a practical updated overview from the pathophysiology to current and future treatment strategies. By integrating this knowledge, we aim to summarize the diagnosis and therapeutic approach that could effectively mitigate or prevent the progression of DCM.
